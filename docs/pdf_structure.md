## Parsing Notes
- **Heading Detection**: Chapter titles use a consistent pattern (`Chapter <Number>: <Title>`). Major booklet switches appear as level-1 TOC entries; we can segment the PDF by searching for these headings and splitting on level-1 boundaries.
- **Tables**: Equipment lists, proficiencies, and monster stats rely on tabular layouts. `pdfplumber` with `extract_table` (using explicit table settings) or bounding-box heuristics will be required. For dense stat blocks, consider combining text and table extraction to reconstruct structured entries.
- **Stat Blocks**: Monster entries (Pages 184-197) combine formatted title lines with columns. Track font size/weight to capture names vs. body text. We may need manual templates for predictable fields (AC, HD, etc.).
- **Psionics & Magic**: The New Spells section includes psionic/magic rules that must map to PF2E powers. Tag each spell with source class and level during normalization for later conversion.
- **Adventure Sections**: Adventure text ("A Little Knowledge", DM book) mixes prose with inline stat blocks. Use regex-driven post-processing to detect stat block anchors after raw extraction.
- **Player Aid Cards & Maps**: These pages are mostly graphical; treat as supplemental assets (export as images) rather than textual compendium data.

## Next Actions
1. Implement page segmentation script that produces per-section JSON manifests (`data/raw/manifests/*.json`).
2. Define extraction profiles per section (e.g., `rules_book`, `wanderers_journal`, `monsters`) outlining expected layout and parser parameters.
3. Validate segmentation by sampling extracted text snippets for each section before building full transformations.
