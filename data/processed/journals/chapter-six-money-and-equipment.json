    "content": "<p>To understand commerce and equipment in Dark\nSun, one must understand that Athas is a metalpoor world. In game terms, all metal items-swords,\narmor, coinsare worth considerably more than on\nother AD&D® worlds such as Lynn or Oerth.\nVirtually all Athasian city states issue coins\nminted in tribute to their sorcerer-kings. Also, some\nin dependent dwarven communities and some\nwealthy merchant families mint their own coins\nwhen the precious metals are available to them.\nThough the currencies vary (a gold coin minted in\nTyr might be a bit heavier than the square gold\ncoins that bear the Ryharian family crest), they all\nfall under the standard exchange rates given in the\nPlayers Handbook. On Athas, 100 cp (ceramic\nMonetary Systems\npieces) = 10 sp = 2 ep = 1 gp = 1/5 pp.\nCeramic Pieces and Bits: The most commonly\nused coin throughout Athas is the ceramic piece\n(cp). Ceramic coins can be manufactured from the\nmost common clay of Athas, then glazed in specific\ncolors and kilned to discourage forgery. The molded\nshape of ceramic pieces allows them to be broken\ninto 10 separate pie-shaped pieces. Each of these\nbits is worth 1/10 of a ceramic piece.\nWhat Things Are Worth\nThe equipment lists in the Players Handbook\nshow not only how much each item costs, but what\neach item is worth in typical AD&D game coinage.\nOn Athas, the relative rarity of metal increases\nthe value of metal items. Coins themselves are worth\nmore, so fewer Athasian coins are needed to purchase things that arent made of metal. However,\nmetal items, because of the scarcity of metal coinage, cost relatively the same number of coins as in\nother worlds. When Dark Sun characters make\npurchases from the equipment lists in the Players\nHandbook, therefore, the following rules apply:\nAll nonmetal items cost one percent of the price\nlisted.\nAll metal items cost the price listed.\nThus, the small canoe (a nonmetal item) costs 3\nsp, but the long sword (a metal item) costs 15 gp.\nIf an item is typically a mixture of metal and nonmetal components and the metal components could\nbe replaced easily, the nonmetal price applies. For\nexample, Athasian chariot makers have found ways\nto avoid using metal parts to make an equally sturdy\nchariot, so the nonmetal price of 5 gp applies.\nAll prices listed in the DARK SUN boxed set or\nin any other DARK SUN module or accessory already compensate for the rarity of metals. Prices listed\nin other AD&D game products are not adjusted-the\nrules of conversion apply for them, as well.\nSocieties on Athas exchange goods and services\nin three ways: coin, barter, and service.\nCoin: Transactions where goods or services are\npurchased with money remain quite common on\nAthas, despite the lack of metals: Athas is metalpoor, not metal-depleted. Coins are a readily accepted means of payment and, considering the\nincreased value of coins, are less bulky to carry\naround.\nBarter: Barter is the exchange of goods for other\ngoods: no coins change hands. By its very nature,\nbarter is an age-old ceremony of negotiation. Characters in Dark Sun can enter either a simple or protracted barter.\nSimple Barter: In simple barter, characters compare the costs of the items to be exchanged and then\nmatch the quantities until they are approximately\neven. For example, Kyuln wishes to exchange his\ncrop of rice for a metal bastard sword. On Athas,\nKyulns rice is worth 2 bits (2/10 cp) per pound, and\nthe metal bastard sword he seeks is worth 25 gp\n(2500 cp). Kyuln would have to trade 12,500\npounds of his rice (his entire harvest) to the weaponsmith in exchange for his new metal bastard sword.\nThe weaponsmith might not be that hungry.\nProtracted Barter: In protracted barter, dice are\nthrown and costs recalculated in three separate\n4 9</p>\n<p>rounds before a final exchange is made. Because of\nits complexity, protracted barter works best for items\nthat cost more than 100 gp. For protracted barter,\nthe Charisma scores of the parties involved (usually\na player character and nonplayer character controlled by the DM) must be known.\nIn the first round of protracted barter, each party\nrolls 2d6 and adds the result to his Charisma score;\nthe higher roll wins the round. The winner has\nProfessional\ntalked down the price of the losers barter item by\n10 percent. If either party decides to end the barter,\nit is finished here. If neither party decides to end the\nbarter, it continues to a second round, and then to a\nthird. Protracted barter can last no more than three\nrounds. Once entered into, a transaction will take\nplaceneither party can back out of a deal once\nprotracted barter has commenced.\nIf Kyuln from the previous example (Charisma\nscore of 13) were to enter into protracted barter with\nthe weaponsmith (Charisma score 7), he might get a\nbetter or worse deal. In the first round, Kyuln rolls 7\n(+13 = 20) and the weapons smith rolls 10 (+7\n= 17); Kyuln wins the round. He has talked the\nweaponsmith down 10 percent, so the metal bastard\nsword in question is now worth 22 gp and 5 sp. Both\nmen wish to continue into a second round. Kyuln\nStarting  Money\nrolls 4 (+13 = 17) and the weapons smith rolls 10\n(+7 = 17); the tie means that neither cost is adjusted. In the third and final round, Kyuln rolls a 10\n(+13 = 23) and the smith rolls a 7 (+7 = 14);\nKyuln wins again. He has talked the weaponsmith\ndown to 20 gp for the metal bastard sword, so must\nonly exchange 10,000 pounds of his rice for it.\nService: The services a character renders-from\nthose of the unskilled laborers to those of the prized\nengineersall have their asking price.\nD a i l y\nW e e k l y\nArcher/artillerist\n1 bit\nl  c p\n4 cp\nCavalry, heavy\n3 bits 2 cp, 5 bits\nl sp\neach character starts the campaign with, based on\nthe characters class group. These figures are for\nstarting 3rd-level characters; characters starting at\n1st-level should divide the total by three. Characters\ngenerated as inactive members of the character tree\nalso get starting money. The owning player may\nequip inactive characters at any time prior to using\nthem as active characters.\nAll PCs begin the game with a specific amount of\nmoney. The player should use this starting money to\nequip his character; campaign time need not be\nspent to play out these purchases unless the DM\ndeems it important to his adventure.\nThe following table indicates how much money\nWith both barter and service exchanges, the DM\nshould make certain the goods or services exchanged are needed or desired.

The\ntable below indicates the percentage cost and weight\nof weapons, and modifiers to damage and hit probability for the stats in the Players Handbook.\nThe arquebus is unavailable on Athas.\nArmor\nWeapon Materials Table\nMaterial\nCost\nW t .\nDmg*\nHit Prob.**\nmetal\n1 0 0 %\n1 0 0 %\nbone\n3 0 %\n5 0 %\n- 1\n- 1\nstone/obsidian\n5 0 %\n7 5 %\n- 1\n- 2\nwood\n1 0 %\n5 0 %\n- 2\n- 3\n*The damage modifier subtracts from the damage\nnormally done by that weapon, with a minimum of\none point.\n** this does not apply to missile weapons.\nIn the game and in text, such weapons should always be referred to with their material and make:\nwooden broadsword, bone sickle, metal dagger, and\nso forth. As well as adding flavor to battle scenes,\nthis indication helps the DM keep track of what\ntype of weapon is being used.\nNonmetal weapons detract from the wielders hit\nprobability as well, much in the same way a cursed\nweapon does. Note the hit probability reduction on\nthe players record sheet.\nNonmetal weapons can be enchanted. However,\nenchantment is cumulative with the weapons hit\nprobability modifier; in this case a -1 penalty. The\nnet modifier for a bone dagger +2 is actually +1.\nBreaking Weapons: Obsidian, bone, and wooden\nweapons are prone to breaking. Whenever a successful attack inflicts maximum damage, there is a\n1-in-20 chance that the weapon will break, as per\nthe following example:\nBruth is sent to the arena armed with a bone battle axe against three unarmed gith. In his first\nround, Bruth cleaves through the skull of his first\nopponent (makes a successful attack) and brings\nhim down (rolls an 8 on his 1d8 for damage). Unfortunately, the shock of the blow splinters the bone\nof the axe head (Bruths player rolls a 1 on 1d20\nindicating weapon breakage), leaving him weaponless. Bruths career in the arena may be brief.\nAll forms of armor listed in the Players Handbook are available in Dark Sun. They afford the\nsame AC rating described there.\nMetal Armor in Dark Sun: Two facts on Athas\nconspire to limit the use of metal armor: extreme\nheat and the high price of metal. A suit of field plate\narmor costs 2,000 gp on Athas, the equivalent of\n5I</p>\n<p>200,000 gp on other AD&D ® campaign worlds.\nHousehold Provisions\nSimply put, a sorcerer-king can either purchase several suits of field plate or build a substantial addition to his city walls.\nLikewise, the intense heat across Athas barren\nsurface makes metal armor an unpleasant experiTack and Harness\nence, to say the least. In any daytime combat situation, a character wearing metal armor adds one to\nhis THAC0 for every round of combat beyond the\nfirst and will collapse, exhausted from the heat, in a\nnumber of rounds equal to his Constitution score.\nAlternate Materials: Many types of armor can be\nShields: Shields are mostly constructed with layers of leather stretched over a wooden or bone frame\nTransport\nand hardened. Effective shields can also be constructed of chitinous materials scavenged from dead\ninsectoids. Though made of alternate materials,\nshields on Athas come in the typical varieties: bucklers and small, medium, or body shields.\nconstructed without metal on Athas, using more\nreadily available materials.\nLeather Armor: Perhaps the most common type\nof armor used on Athas, leather armor is shaped to\nthe individual wearing it, and then hardened.\nPadded Armor: As described in the Players\nHandbook, this armor is made from heavy cloth\nand batting. Many Athasian warriors prefer padded armor woven from giants hair.\nHide Armor: Hide armor on Athas is usually\nconstructed from mekillot or braxat hide.\nStudded Leather, Ring Mail, Brigandine, and\nScale \nMail \nArmor: \nThese \nvarieties \nof \narmor \nare\nconstructed using pieces of bone or chitin.\nChain, Splint, Banded, Bronze Plate, or Plate\nMail; Field Plate and Full Plate Armor: These\ntypes of armor must be made with metal components, making them both expensive and potentially\ndeadly in the days heat.\nNew Equipment\nThe following equipment is generally available in\npopulated sectors of Athas for the prices shown.\ninix\ninix, war\nmekillot\nmekillot, war\nWagon, open\n1,000 pound capacity\n2,500 pound capacity\n5,000 pound capacity\n10,000 pound capacity\nWagon, enclosed\n1,000 pound capacity\n2,500 pound capacity\n5,000 pound capacity\n10,000 pound capacity\nWagon, armored caravan\nChariot\none kank, one warrior\ntwo kank, two warrior\nfour kank, three warrior\nHowdah\nBarding\nInix, leather\n35 sp\n240 lb\nInix, chitin\n50 sp\n400 lb\nKank, leather\n15 sp\n70 lb\nKank, chitin\n35 sp\n120 lb\nMekillot, leather\n500 sp\n1000 lb\nMekillot, chitin\n750 sp\n1600 lb\nTun of water (250 gal.)\n1 sp\nFire Kit\n2 bits\n10 sp\n25 sp\n50 sp\nl sp\n10 sp\n2 sp\n50 sp\n10 cp\n20 cp\n30 cp\n50 cp\n15 cp\n25 cp\n40 cp\n60 cp\n100 sp\n5 2</p>\n<p>Animals\nEquipment Descriptions\nErdlu\nHousehold Provisions\nInix\nKank\nTrained\nUntrained\nMekillot\n10 cp\n10 sp\n12 sp\n5 sp\n20 sp\nTun of Water: In most Athasian cities, water is\ndrawn from a collective cistern maintained by the\nsorcerer-king and his templars. It is not at all uncommon for the price of water to increase dramatically during particularly dry periods or when the\ntemplars are attempting to extort more money from\nconsumers.\nWeapons\nDamage\nCost\nWt\nSize\nType\nSpeed\nS-M\nL\nChatkcha\nImpaler\nPolearm,\nGythka\nQuabone\nWrist Razor\n1 cp\n½\n4 cp\n5\n6 cp\n1 2\n1 cp\n4\n1 sp\n1\nS\nM\nL\nM\nS\nS\nP\nP / B\nP / S\nS\n4\n1 d 6 + 2\n5\n1d8\n7\n2d4\n7\n1d4\n2\n1 d 6 + 1\n1 d 4 + 1\n1d8\n1 d 1 0\n1d3\n1 d 4 + 1\n53</p>\n<p>Fire Kit: Though flint is readily available, steel is\nscarce on Athas. The standard fire-starting kit\ntherefore uses a bow and sticks rather than flint and\nsteel.\nBarding: There are two types of barding for the\nvarious beasts of burden on Athas: leather and chitin. Leather barding is made with stiffened leather\npads, often reinforced with bone or chitin, and\njoined together with cloth or soft leather straps.\nLeather barding affords the animal a -1 bonus to\nits AC. Chitin barding is made from plates of insectoid chitin and bone, fastened together with leather\nand cloth. Chitin barding affords the animal an\nAC bonus of -2. The two types of barding cannot\nbe combined.\nChariot: A chariot is a lightly armored vehicle\nc o n s t r u c t e d  o f  w o o d ,  c h i t i n ,  a n d  h a r d e n e d\nleatherm, designed for riding and combat. The\ndriver of the chariot must have either the teamster/\nfreighter secondary skill or the charioteering proficiency. \nThe \nchariot \ndriver \ncan \nattack \nwith\nsingle-handed weapons while the vehicle is moving,\nbut suffers a -4 penalty to all attack rolls. Others\nin the vehicle suffer no penalty to melee attack rolls,\nbut have a -1 penalty to missile attack rolls while\nthe chariot is moving. Those in a chariot have 50%\ncover from the front or sides, 25% cover from the\nflank or rear (consult the Dungeon Masters Guide\nfor the exact effects of cover and concealment on\ncombat). If one of the animals hitched to a multikank chariot dies or is maimed, the chariots speed\nis reduced to I/3 that of normal. The slain beast may\nalso cause the chariot to crash, but the fallen animal\ncan then be cut loose by survivors. Multiple deaths\nin the animal team bring the chariot to a halt.\nHowdah: A howdah is a frame with seats designed to be mounted on the back of an inix or meWagon, armored caravan: An armored caravan\nwagon weighs 5,000 pounds and can carry up to\n35,000 pounds more. The exact design of any particular armored caravan wagon can change from\ntrip to trip. Artisans customize the interior for each\njourney, adding or taking away slave pens, expanding or removing enclosures, and so forth. In general,\nan armored war caravan can carry a cargo of\n15,000 pounds of goods, plus have room for 50 fully\narmed warriors, 25 slaves in transit, and a handful\nsame animal power as similar-capacity open wagons. Items within enclosed wagons are little affected\nby weather. Some merchants and nomads convert\nenclosed wagons into living quarters. Individuals\nriding within enclosed wagons are considered at rest\nand shaded.\nWagons, enclosed: Enclosed wagons require the\na wooden box on four wooden wheels. A 1,000pound-capacity wagon requires a single kank to pull\nit. The 2,500- pound-and 5,000-pound-capacity\nwagons need teams of two and four kanks, respectively. \nThe \n10,000-pound-capacity \nrequires \na \nsingle\nmekillot to move. Inix are not used to pull wagons\nfor the simple reason that their tails get in the way.\nWagons, open: An open wagon is little more than\nAnyone riding in a howdah is considered to be at\nrest and shaded.\nA war howdah is constructed of much sturdier\nmaterials, affording cover to those within. An inix\nwar howdah weighs 150 pounds and can hold four\nfighters. A mekillot war howdah is a more elaborate\naffair, weighing 1,000 pounds. Within the mekillot\nwar howdahs two levels 16 warriors may ride, four\nof which can fight to any one side at a given time.\nSoldiers in a war howdah can choose to have 25%,\n50%, 75%, or 30% cover and concealment (consult\nthe Dungeon Masters Guide for the exact effects of\ncover and concealment on combat).\nkillot. A normal howdah is made of a light wooden\nframe and has one seat for the animals driver. Normal howdahs do not count against the carrying capacity of the animal, but the drivers weight does.\nTack and Harness\nTransportation\n5 4</p>\n<p>of merchants, nobles, or other stately travelers. Soldiers in an armored caravan wagon can choose to\nhave 25%, 50%, 75%, or 30% cover and concealment (consult the Dungeon Masters Guide for the\nexact effects of cover and concealment on combat).\nWhile one mekillot can pull an armored caravan\nwagon, they are usually drawn by a team of two, to\nprevent the death of a mount stranding the wagon.\nAnimals\nErdlu: Erdlus are herd beasts raised by many different cultures on Athas. These large, flightless\nbirds stand up to seven feet tall and weigh around\n200 pounds. Their omnivorous diet allows them to\ngraze nearly anywhere and their hardy nature keeps\nWeapons\nthem alive in harsh terrain. The price of a single\nerdlu can be as much as double that listed or as little\nas half, depending upon availability. Erdlus eggs\nare also edible: one egg can fetch 3 bits.\nInix: An inix is a large lizard animal that grows to\nas much as 16 feet long. Each can carry up to 2000\npounds. Though herbivorous by nature, inix are vicious combatants, attacking with both tail and bite.\nInix trained for riding are also trained not to fight\nwhile mounted, for no rider could manage to keep\nhis seat while an inix thrashed its mighty tail.\nInix can be fitted with a howdah. Half-giants use\nthem as individual mounts. Inix cannot generally\npull wagons because of their lengthy tails.\nKank: Kanks serve as both herd animals and\nbeasts of burden. They are large insectoids, 4 feet\nhigh and 8 feet long, weighing around 400 pounds.\nAs herd animals, kanks are durable and easily tended. Kanks are not raised for their meat, which becomes foul-smelling as soon as they die. Instead,\nthey are raised for honey globules produced on their\nbellies. A single honey globule can bring 4 bits.\nAs riding beasts, kanks provide effective transportation for a single character (except for halfgiants, who use inix for the same purpose). A kank\ncan carry up to 400 pounds. Kanks used as riding\nanimals also require harnesses and saddles. The\ntack and harness prices given in the Players Handbook for horses work well for kanks also.\nKanks can be hitched to wagons individually or in\nteams. A character needs the teamster/freighter\nsecondary skill or the animal handling proficiency to\neffectively operate teams of kanks.\nMekillot: A mekillot is an enormous G-ton lizard,\nused as a beast of burden. Each one can carry 8,000\npounds or pull up to 40,000 pounds behind it. Mekillots are hard to control and sometimes turn on\ntheir handlers.\nA mekillot can be fitted with a pack howdah or a\nwar howdah, carrying several men into combat.\nChatkcha: This thri-kreen throwing weapon is\ncommon among the steppes tribes. It is a crystal\nwedge that can be thrown up to 30 yards and, due to\nits spin and affect upon the air, still return to the\nthrower if it misses the target.\nGythka: This thri-kreen polearm has wicked\nblades at either end. The weapons thick shaft allows it to be used like a quarterstaff against similarly\narmed opponents.\nImpaler: An impaler is a weapon developed for\narena combat. It has a single shaft about 4 feet long\nwith a pair of long pointed blades, splitting to each\nside and forming deadly T The weapon can be\nswung horizontally or vertically, over the head.\nQuabone: This weapon is constructed from four\nidentical shanks of bone, lashed together to form a\nradially symmetrical, sword-length rod. With its\nlightness and crudely sharpened end, the quabone\nis a fairly ineffective weapon. The quabone is used\nin arena situations where combat is intended to\ndraw out for a long period of time.\nWrist Razor: Wrist razors consist of a trio of\nblades that protrude from a heavy arm band. The\nrazors project out over the back of the hand, are\nextremely sharp, and can be up to 6 inches long.\nWrist razors can be worn on one or both forearms.\n55</p>",
