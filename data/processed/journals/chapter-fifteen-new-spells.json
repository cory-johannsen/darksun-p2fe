The influences of\nfoul defilers, the valiant efforts of preserves, and the\ncorrupt researches of sorcerer-kings have left their\nSecond-Level Spells\nmark upon the wizards trade. This chapter highDetect Psionics (Divination)\nlights important differences between Dark Sun and\nmagic in other AD&D® game worlds.\nWizard Spells\nFirst Level Spells\nCharm Person\nAthasian creatures that can be charmed include\nall PC races except thri-kreen, plus the belgoi.\nFind Familiar\nIn DARK SUN campaigns, substitute this table\nfor that found in the Players Handbook.\nDie Roll Familiar\nS e n s o r y  P o w e r s\n1-3 \nBat\nNight, sonar-enhanced\nvision\n4 - 5  B e e t l e\nSenses minute vibrations\n6 - 8  C a t ,  b l a c k\nExcellent night vision and\nsuperior hearing\n9\nPseudodragon Normal sensory powers,\nbut very intelligent\n1 0 - 1 1  R a t\nExcellent sense of taste\nand smell\n1 2 - 1 5  S c o r p i o n\nSenses fear\n1 6 - 2 0  S n a k e\nSensitivity to subtle temperature changes\nIn DARK SUN campaigns, substitute this table\nFools Gold\nfor that found in the Players Handbook.\n1st-3rd level\n4th-7th level\n8th-12th \nlevel\n13th-14th \nlevel\nWild Kank\nTrained \nKank\nInix\nMekillot (and howdah at\n18th level)\n15th level & up\nRoc (and saddle at 18th\nlevel)\nRange: 0\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: 2 rounds/level\nCasting Time: 2\nArea of Effect: sphere (10 yard/level diameter)\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell is similar to the metapsionic devotion,\npsionic sense, but uses magical rather than psionic\nmeans. The spell allows a character to detect the\nexpenditure of psionic strength points (PSPs) in a\nsphere around him. The diameter of the sphere is\nequal to the range of the spell.\nAt level (4 or below), the spell only lets the characsphere, not how many PSPs, from what individual,\nwhat powers or devotions were used, or whether the\nPSPs were expended to initialize a power or to\nmaintain one.\nCasters who are of levels 5-7 will also learn what\nindividual within the sphere is expending PSPs.\nCasters of level 8-11 will also learn what discipline the psionicist is calling upon and whether the\npoints were spent to maintain or initiate a psionic\neffect.\nFinally, casters of level 12 or higher will learn exactly which science or devotion is being used.\nCopper coins are seldom minted on Athas. However, copper is still the medium of this spell and can\nbe turned into solid gold. In DARK SUN campaigns, the area of effect is reduced to 1 cubic inch,\nor about 15 gold coins, per level.\nter know that PSPs were expended within the\nMount\nCaster Level\nM o u n t\n9 0</p>\n<p>Third Level Spells\nFleet Feet (Alteration)\n(Reversible)\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M\nM a s s m o r p h\nDuration: 1 day/5 levels\nCasting Time: 3\nArea of Effect: one individual\nSaving Throw: Neg.\nThis spell allows an individual to move more\nquickly. The person affected can take very large\nstrides, as if his feet and legs weighed far less than\nthey actually do. For purposes of cross country\nPlant Growth\nmovement, an affected character can travel double\nhis normal movement rate (and may still force\nmarch beyond that, though he is still subject to\nthose effects). The characters movement rate is\ndoubled in combat situations, as well, but his balPsionic Dampener (Alteration)\nance and inertia make it difficult to maneuver. If he\nmoves greater than his normal movement rate and\nattempts to turn in any way, such as to round a corner or to avoid an obstacle, he must make a successful Dexterity check to avoid falling (ending his\nmovement for the round and making him prone).\nThe reverse of this spell, stone feet, makes the affected characters legs feel as heavy as rock, slowing\nhis movement to half. The characters balance is\nunaffected. A saving throw negates this effect.\nThe material component for this spell is a feather\nfrom a flightless bird, such as an erdlu (or for the\nreverse, a piece of mekillot hide).\nPhantom Steed\nIn DARK SUN campaigns, this spell creates a\nkank-like creature with the same abilities listed in\nthe Players Handbook.\nFourth Level Spells\nIce Storm\nIn DARK SUN campaigns, the water, hail, and\nice created by this spell is only temporary. It will disappear three turns after the completion of the spell.\nEven water consumed in that time disappears, giving its imbiber no benefit.\nSince trees might be somewhat conspicuous in\nDARK SUN campaigns, the caster of this spell\nhas the option of making the affected creatures appear to be boulders and stones, instead. The material components must be any handful of available\npebbles.\nThis spell has no effect on a tree of life. Since a\ndefiled area has no vegetation left, this spell has no\neffect if cast there.\nRange: 5 yards/level\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: Special\nCasting Time: 4\nArea of Effect: one individual\nSaving Throw: Neg.\nUse of this spell allows the caster to disrupt the\npsionic activities of one individual. The target is allowed a saving throw to negate the spell. Whether\nsuccessful or not, the target immediately knows that\nthe spell was cast and who cast it.\nIf the spell is successful, the target is unable to\nexpend PSPs for its duration. The spell lasts until\nthe wizard stops concentrating, either voluntarily or\ninvoluntarily. The affected psionicist can otherwise\nfunction normally. If the affected psionicist moves\nand he can\nreenters the\nagain use PSPs normally, even if he\nspells area of effect.\nbeyond the range, the spell is broken\nThe material component for this spell is any small\nobject within a blown glass sphere.\n91</p>\n<p>92\nRaze (Alteration)\nWall of Ice\nThis spell grants the ability to support vegetation\nThis spell turns a volume of sand into an equal\nvolume of sandstone. The caster can choose any\nsimple shape he desires, provided no single portion\nis smaller than one cubic foot and none of the shape\nexceeds the range of the spell. The spell does not\nconfer the ability to move the sand or stone created;\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: 2d6 days\nCasting Time: 4\nArea of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level\nSaving Throw: None\nRange: 10 yards/level\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: Special\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: 5 radius/level\nSaving Throw: None\nThe mud created by this spell is of a magical\nnatureno water can be gotten out of it.\nLike the ice storm spell, the ice created disappears\nthree turns after the conclusion of the spell.\nThe material components for this spell are a\nhandful of ash (either from a previous raze spell or\nfrom normal defiler magic) and a pinch of salt.\nThis spell duplicates the life-draining effects peculiar to defiling magic. The spell may be cast by a\ndefiler or a preserver, though a defiler will cause\nmore damage with it.\nThe casting of the spell causes a large area of vegetation to instantly give up its magical potential and\nturn to ash. Unlike the natural destruction of defiling magic, raze affects all vegetation within the radius of the spell, regardless of the terrain. The area of\neffect for a preserver is one yard per level of the caster. For a defiler, it is five yards plus one yard per level\nof the caster (in lieu of normal defiling damage).\nThe ash created is black and grey, completely devoid of life or life-giving elements. Nothing will grow\nthere for half a year, leaving a lifeless circular scar\non the ground.\nThe material component for the spell is sand\nground between two pebbles (or sand from an hour\nglass for the reverse).\nthe stone will occupy the space where the sand was\nat the time of casting. Persons standing with their\nfeet in the sand at the time of casting will have to\nbreak themselves free, though a saving throw vs.\nparalyzation is allowed to jump free, (if possible).\nThe fact that an area of sand has been so turned to\nsandstone is not readily apparent even after the spell\nhas been cast. Viewers may have to make an Intelligence check to notice that there is stone where there\nwas once sand. Though permanent, the magically\ncreated sandstone will quickly break down into sand\nparticles over a period of 2d6 days. The reverse of\nthis spell, transmute stone to sand, allows the caster\nto change any type of stone to sand (sandstone,\ngranite, gems, clay brick, concrete, etc.). Stone\nitems such as weapons become useless. Floors turned to sand may cause those standing on them to lose\ntheir balance and fall (dexterity check to avoid).\nSupporting stones in buildings so affected can easily\ncause a structure to completely collapse.\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: Permanent\nCasting Time: 5 rounds\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nT r a n s m u t e  S a n d  t o  S t o n e  ( A l t e r a t i o n )\nReversible\nFifth-Level Spells\nTransmute Rock to Mud\nRejuvenate (Alteration)</p>\n<p>to an area of ground. In the case of ground made\nbarren by defiler magic, rejuvenate dispels the\ngrounds sterility, making it immediately capable of\nsupporting vegetation. The spell may be cast on any\nTransmute Water to Dust\nground short of solid rock, including sand, rocky\nsand or soil, or dust.\n86-89\nM u l\n90-96\nThri-kreen\n97-00\nYuan-ti\nIn DARK SUN campaigns, this spell has no reverse.\nIn either case, the spell affects the ground in a\ncircle extending away from the caster, so he must\nstand in the middle of the area he wishes to revitalSeventh-Level Spells\nize. The radius of the circle is 5 feet per level of the\nDoom Legion (Necromancy)\ncaster. Once cast, the soil is enriched and moistened, and a layer of fine grass emerges instantly.\nThe duration of the spell varies. Once cast, the\nmoist soil and grass are not magical, and are subject\nto all natural forces upon them. They will, however,\nsurvive a week in even the worst of conditions. Rejuvenate will otherwise last until another defiler spell\ndestroys the vegetation there.\nThe material component of the spell is a seed (of\nany type) and a drop of water.\nDefilers cannot cast rejuvenate.\nRange: 0\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: Permanent\nCasting Time: 7 rounds\nArea of Effect: 120 yard radius\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell creates skeletons or zombies from the\nremains of an army defeated in battle. The spell\nmust be cast on the site of the conflict, where the\nfallen bodies still lie. When cast, only the bodies or\nskeletons of the losing side will be animated.\nWall of Iron\nIn DARK SUN  campaigns, the duration of\nthis spell is one turn per level of the caster.\nIf the battle took place less than three months before the casting of the spell, the undead will be zomb i e s .  A n y  l o n g e r  p e r i o d  o f  t i m e  w i l l  y i e l d\nskeletonseven if the bones have turned to dust,\nSixth Level Spells\nthey will reassemble when this spell is cast.\nR e i n c a r n a t i o n\nIn DARK SUN campaigns, substitute this table\nfor that found in the Players Handbook.\nD100 \nRoll\nIncarnation\n01-08\nAarakocra\n09-16\nBelgoi\n17-24\nDwarf\n25-32\nElf\n33-34\nGiant\n35-37\nGiant-kin, Cyclops\n38-48\nHalf-elf\n49-55\nHalf-giant\n56-66\nHalfling\n67-78\nHuman\n79-85\nKenku\nThe number animated depends upon the radius\nof the spell and the number of bodies within it. The\nDM decides what level of conflict was fought on the\ngrounds where the spell is cast, then rolls dice to\nfind how many undead are raised:\nS k i r m i s h  3 d 1 2\nSmall Battle 6d12\nMajor Battle 10d20\nAnimated bodies that are less than 1 yard beneath the surface will dig themselves out within one\nturn of casting the spell. Those deeper will not animate. The bodies cannot have been disturbed before the casting of the spell-those that are moved,\nsearched, or in any way disturbed do not animate.\n93</p>\n<p>Time at Rest\nChance to Ignore\nPriest Spells\nFirst-Level Spells\nCreate Water\nM e r c i f u l  S h a d o w s  ( A b j u r a t i o n )\n( R e v e r s i b l e )\nBy means of this spell, a wizard can enchant a\nliving sapling to become a magical tree of life.

The individual must have twice the water per day for the dur a t i o n  o f  t h e  s p e l l  o r  s u f f e r  t h e  e f f e c t s  o f\ndehydration.

The\nindividual so protected appears normal, except that\nhe doesnt sweat as much as expected and his coloration is a bit gray.\nShould the army not ignore him, the undead will\nconsider the spell caster its new leader and will follow him until every individual is somehow destroyed.\nThe material components for this spell are a drop\nof blood from one of the units old opponents (or a\ndescendent thereof) plus a handful of soil from the\nunits original homeland.\nSphere: Cosmos\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: 1 day/5 levels\nCasting Time: 1 round\nArea of Effect: Person touched\nSaving Throw: Neg.\nwill not necessarily attack him, but it will not obey\nhim. It will pursue revenge for its defeat, advancing\non its previous enemy, even if that no longer makes\nsense, considering the passage of time.\nIn Dark Sun, create water produces only one half\ngallon of water per level of the caster.

When doing so against non-mobile targets, no attack roll is necessary and any normally\ncombustible material (cloth, wood, paper, etc.) will\nignite. Personal equipment may also be targeted,\nbut the priest must make a successful attack roll\nwith a -4 penalty. If hit, the article of equipment\nignites. Burning clothing will inflict 1d6 points of\ndamage for 1d6 rounds or until discarded. Burning\nshields become useless.
