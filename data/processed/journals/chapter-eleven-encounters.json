    "content": "<p>Encounters in the DARK SUN fantasy world\noccur exactly as described in generic AD&D® campaigns. Surprise rolls and encounter distances appear in the Players Handbook, and the philosophy\nand details of encounters appear in the Dungeon\nMasters Guide. The additional rules given here\nspecifically target Dark Sun encounters, making\nthem easier and faster to run for the DM.\nWizard, Priest, and Psionicist\nEncounters\nSpellcasters and psionicists pose numerable problems for the DM, not the least of which is deciding\nwhat spells or psionic powers they can use at the\ntime of the encounter. In instances when the DM\nhas particular spells he needs NPCs to have, he\nshould choose those spells and fill out the rest, using\nthe system given there.\nAt times, an encounter with a large group of creatures calls for multiple spell casters or psionicists.\nThe DM may wish to roll their spells or powers as a\ngroup to save time. Encounters where 15 elven\npsionicists can all perform different psionic actions\nmay be interesting, but are nightmarish for the\nDM. Rolling for spells or powers as a group simplifies the action and can satisfy for DMs and players\nalike.\nEncounters in City-States\nAthasian city states are usually very crowded and\nbusy: half-elven merchants loudly hawk their wares\nin bazaars and street corners; slaves and peasants\nbear nobles high on sedan chairs and force their way\nroughly through the throngs; templar guards patrol\nthe streets against the many thieves and low-lifes\nthat scurry through the alleys and sewers. Even at\nnight, the decadent lifestyles of the wealthy keep the\ncity alive with festivals and parties that last until the\ndawn.\nWhen dealing with encounters in a city, it is more\nappropriate to ask whom the player characters do\n77\nnot encounter than whom they do. Any normal\ndenizen of the cities-peasants, slaves, templar\nguards, merchants, nobles-can be located without\nmuch trouble: they are ubiquitous. If the player\ncharacters wish to avoid some particular encounter,\nsuch as with the city guards or with a particular aristocrat, that too is fairly easy; city states throng with\ncrowds.\nSpecific encounters should be set up by the DM.\nThese will mostly be adventure-specific, presenting\nthe player characters with individuals that will help\nor hinder their progress.\nMonsters\nMany of the monsters presented in the AD&D\nM o n s t r o u s  C o m p e n d i u m s  a r e  a p p r o p r i a t e  f o r\nDARK SUN campaigns. They should be used in\naddition to those new monsters given in the Wanderers Guide. In many cases, these creatures have\nadapted themselves to the more harsh, arid condi\ntions on Athas.\nMagic: Those creatures capable of casting spells\nshould be treated as defilers. When they cast spells,\nthey ruin the ground around them, according to\nspell-level, just as described in Chapter 7: Magic.\nAs a result, spell-wielding monsters rarely cast spells\ndirectly from their lair. Those who merely have spelllike abilities do not cause defiling damage when using those abilities.\nPsionics: Of all the monsters in the following list,\nonly yuan-ti have psionic powers (according to the\nComplete Psionics Handbook). However, all those\nmarked with an asterisk could possess wild powers in\nDARK SUN campaigns. Whether or not an individual creature is a wild talent is the DMs decision.\nPlant-Based Monsters: Defiling magic destroys\nall plant-life within its area of effect without exception. A plant-based monster can thus be destroyed\nForgotten Realms® (MC3)\n(or injured if it isnt wholly contained within the area\nof effect), with no save allowed.\nMonstrous Compendium 1 and 2\nA a r a k o c r a *\nAerial Servant\nAnkheg\nA n t\nDragonlance® (MC4)\nAnt Lion, Giant\nBasilisk\nB a t\nBeetle\nB e h i r *\nBulette\nCats, Great\nCave Fisher\nCentipede\nD r a g o n n e *\nElementals, all\nGreyhawk® (MC5)\nEttercap*\nE t t i n *\nGenie, all *\nGiant-kin, Cyclops*\nGolem\nHornet\nK e n k u *\nLizard\nPseudodragon*\nPlant, Carnivorous\nR a t\nRemorhaz\nR o t\nSandling\nScorpion\nSkeleton\nSnake (except Sea, Giant)\nSpider\nWyvern*\nYuan-ti*\nZombie\nBhaergala*\nM e a z e l *\nRhaumbusun\nStrider, Giant\nThessalmonster\nThri-kreen*\nFire Minion*\nHatori\nHorax\nInsect Swarm\nSkrit\nS l i g *\nT y l o r *\nWyndlass\nBeetle\nBonesnapper\nDragonfly, Giant\nDragonnel\nHorgar\n7 8</p>\n<p>Plant, Carnivorous (Cactus, Vampire)\nKara-Tur (MC6)\nGoblin Spider*\nJishin Mushi\n*indicates possible psionic wild power\nN o  c r e a t u r e s  f r o m  t h e  S P E L L J A M M E R \nMonstrous Compendiums live on Athas. Fiends\nfrom the Outer Planes Appendix (MC10) can travel to and from Athas at will, but do so rarely, only\nwhen summoned by dragons or great wizards.\nWilderness Encounters\nThe wilds of Athas are teeming with intelligent\nand unintelligent monsters. Encounters in the wilderness should be rolled for on a daily basis or as\nthe DM sees fit. Obviously, if characters are lost or\nunprepared, even the most routine wilderness encounters can prove to be fatal for the party.\nEach of the tables below lists monsters for encounters in a particular terrain type. The monsters\nlisted come from the Wanderers Guide and from\nMonstrous Compendiums I and II. The other monsters listed as appropriate to Dark Sun can be added, as well, if you have the appropriate Monstrous\nC o m p e n d i u m s .\nWhen encounters occur should be determined using the Frequency & Chance of Wilderness Encounters table in the DMG.\nStoney Barrens\nDie Roll\nSandy Wastes\n2\nCreature\nDie Roll\n3\nC r e a t u r e\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\ngai\nbulette\nroc\ngenie, dao\nankheg\nwyvern\nbasilisk, lesser\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\ngenie, djinn\nbasilisk, dracolisk\nspotted lion\nlizard, minotaur\nwasp\n7 9\n7\n1 0\n1 1\n12\n13\n1 4\n15\n16\n1 7\n18\n17\n2 0\nspider, huge\ngith\nettercap/ behir\ncentipede, giant\nbeetle, boring\nbaazrag\ntembo\nbraxat\nbat, huge\nettin\nbasilisk, greater\nant, swarm</p>\n<p>Mountains\nDie Roll\nCreature\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n1 1\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n17\n2 0\n7\nsnake, giant constrictor\n8\nsnake, constrictor\n9\nsandling\n10\nelves/gith\n11\nkank\n12\nscorpion, huge\n13\nslaves\n14\ninix\n15\nanakore\n16\njozhal\n17\nspider, phase\n18\ncentipede, megalo17\nyuan-ti\n20\ndragonne\nlizard, fire\nettin\nroc\nant, giant\ngiant-kin, cyclops\nlizard, giant\nleopard\nbeetle, fire\nbat, common\nhalflings/dwarves\ngith\nslaves\nkenku\nspider, giant\nettercap\nzombie\naarakocra\npseudodragon\nbulette\n8 0</p>\n<p>Scrub Plains\nDie Roll\nCreature\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n1 0\n1 1\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n1 7\n18\ngenie, jann\nremorhaz\nbehir\nant lion, giant\nmekillot\nsilk wyrm\ncheetah\nerdlu\ngith\nelves/slaves\nkank\nrat, giant\nscorpion, large\nspider, giant\nbat, huge\nplant, carnivorous, man\ntrap\npseudodragon\ngaj\njaguar\n19\n2 0\nRocky Badlands\nDie Roll\nCreature\n2\naarakocra\n3\ndragonne\n4\ngiant-kin, cyclops\n5\nroc\n6\nankheg\n7\nbelgoi\n8\nlizard, giant\n9\nbeetle, fire\n10\nspider, large\n1 1\ngith/dwarves\n12\nkluzd\n13\nrat, giant\n14\ncommon lion\n15\nhornet\n1 6\nbat, huge\n1 7\nbraxat\n18\nzombie, monster\n19\nremorhaz\n2 0\ng a j\n10\nscorpion, huge\n1 1\nzombie\n12\ncentipede, giant\n13\nspider, large\n1 4\nlizard , giant\n15\nbat, large\n16\nskeleton\n1 7\nspider, phase\n2\nbasilisk, dracolisk\n3\nzombie, ju ju\n4\nsnake, spitting\n5\nant, giant\n6\nwasp\n7\nwyvern\n8\nhornet\n9\nskeleton\n18\ngiant\n19\ngenie, efreeti\n2 0\nant, swarm\nSalt Flats\nDie Roll\nC r e a t u r e\n8 I</p>",
