The frequency and quantities of coins in these treasures is\nless than most AD&D® camapign adventurers will\nbe used to.\nMagical Items\nNo platinum or electrum pieces are regularly\nminted on Athas. The metal, is occasionally found\nin small amounts, but not enough to warrant inclusion on the table. Finds of platinum or electrum will\nbe special treasures placed by the DM.\nBits are one-tenth pie pieces of a ceramic piece.\nWhen found, they may or may not be completely\nbroken into individual bits; some may still be unbroken or partially broken coins.\nCeramic, silver, and gold pieces weigh in at 50 to\nthe pound. Five hundred bits weigh 1 pound.\nGems\nWhere metals are very rare, gems become a more\nfrequent medium of exchange. On Athas, gems are\nfairly common and still quite valuable.\nGem Table\nD 1 0 0\nBase\nRoil\nValue\nCl ass\n0 1 - 2\n15 cp\nOrnamental\n26-50\n75 cp\nsemi-precious\n51-70\n15 sp\nFancy\n71-90\n75 sp\nPrecious\n91-99\n15 gp\nGems\n00\n75 gp\nJewels\nThe gem variations and descriptions of the individual stones from the DMG still apply to gems\nfound in Dark Sun.\nObjects of Art\nArt is not usually a part of lair treasures on\nAthas. Such finds will be specially placed by the\nDM. The objects of art table in the DMG is appropriate for determining the price of such items, except that the number ranges represent ceramic piece\nvalue, not gold piece. Items consisting of steel make\na valuable treasure, as well.\nThe nature of magical items found in DARK\nSUN campaigns is discussed in Chapter 7: Magic.\nWhen magical items are found as part of a lair treasure, Table 88: Magical Items (from the DMG) will\nsuffice to determine each items general category.\nSubsequent rolls on the subtables yield a variety of\nspecific items, though the DM may find some have\nnames that are anachronistic to DARK SUN campaigns. For instance, gauntlets of ogre power are\nvery useful on Athas, but Athas holds no ogres.\nThe various items of giant strength have the same\nproblem because DARK SUN campaigns do not\nuse the traditional pantheon of giants.\nIf a Dark Sun DM rolls up a random magical\ntreasure item with an inappropriate name, he\nshould either change the name or, better yet, dont\ngive the players a name for the item at all. This latter solution makes PCs cautious with their newfound magical items, testing them carefully for\npowers that, were they to know the official name,\nthey might recognize from years of play.\nOther magical items in the DMG are anachronistic not in name only. In magical item descriptions, the mention of humanoids not native to Dark\nSun obviously do not apply.\nA final group of items so contradicts the environment of Athas that they either do not exist, or have\nbeen changed.\npotion of dragon control, scroll of protection from\ndragon breath, bag of tricks, bucknards everfull\npurse, decanter of endless water, horseshoes (all),\nstone horse, hammer +3 dwarven thrower, elven\nchain, and any item having to do with aquatic settings or lycanthropes.\nThe following items are changed to fit DARK SUN\n7 4</p>\n<p>campaigns:\n Potion of Giant Control: Affects any giant.\n Potion of Giant Strength: The strength equivalent names do not apply in the Dark Sun campaign, though all the listed benefits are the same.\n Potion of Undead Control: Roll the 1d10 normally; the result is the maximum Hit Dice of the\nundead that the potion can control.\n Rod of Resurrection: Charges required are gladiator 2, templar 2, psionicist 4, half-giant 6, thrikreen 2, and mul 2.\n Boots of Varied Tracks: Substitute Dark Sun animal tracks for those listed.\n Candle of Invocation: Rather than invoking pantheons of gods, these draw upon the spirits of the\nlands or the elemental planes.\n Deck of Illusions: Though many of the creatures\nlisted are not native to Athas, they can still serve\nas illusions.\n Figurines of Wondrous Power: Keep ebony fly\nand golden lion. Characters will find no other figunless otherwise stated in the description.\nurines on Athas.\n Necklace of Prayer Beads: The bead of summons calls a powerful creature from the elemental\nplanes, instead.\nPotions\nOn Athas, potions come in the form of magical\nfruits or berries. The juices of the fruit hold the\nmagical properties of the potion and the fruit must\nbe eaten to release the magical effect. In Dark Sun,\npotions are never found as fluids in a flask or vial.\nAny juicy berry or fruit may be enchanted with a\npotion. Since the juice itself holds the potion, drier\nfruits such as dates cannot be so enchanted. The\ntype of fruit chosen to house the potion has no effect; any fruit can contain any potion.\nAny potion listed on Table 89: Potions and Oils\nin the Dungeon Masters Guide can be enchanted\ninto a fruit. On Athas, these may be referred to as\npotions or fruits, interchangeably (a potion of giant\nstrength is the same as a fruit of giant strength).\nOnce the skin of the fruit is broken, it must be eaten\nwithin one turn or the potions magic is lost.\nWhereas normal fruits may only remain ripe for a\nfew days or weeks before they begin to rot, potion\nfruits have their period of ripeness greatly extended.\nOnce enchanted with a potion, a fruit will remain\nripe for 99 years. After that time, the enchantment\nfades and the fruit will rot normally.\nThe entire fruit must be eaten to gain the effect of\nthe potion. This takes an entire round. Fruits that\nare enchanted with oil-type potions must be crushed\nand the juice allowed to run over the user, which\ntakes two rounds.\nPotion fruits cannot be identified by taste. A detect magic spell will identify a fruit or tree as magical, but only identify or similar magic provides a\npositive identification.\nPotion fruits can be combined. Different potion\nfruits eaten concurrently will all have their effects on\nthe ingester. Potion fruit duration is 4+1d4 turns\nFruits may be enchanted with potions in one of\ntwo fashions: magical and botanical enchantment.\nMagical Enchantment: Any wizard, cleric, or\ndruid can enchant normal fruits into potions. Magical enchantment occurs as described under Potions in Chapter 10 of the DMG.\nBotanical Enchantment: Any wizard, ranger,\ncleric, or druid can use botanical enchantment. Botanical enchantment is the process of using one enchanted fruit to grow more.\nThe original potion fruit must be planted unused.\nFrom this seed a magical tree grows very quickly,\nproducing a full-sized fruit tree grows in 1d6 weeks.\nOnce the magical tree is grown, a d6 is rolled: on a\nroll of 1 or 2, two new potion fruits of the same type\nappear on the tree; on a 3-5, one new potion fruit of\nthe same type appears on the tree, and on a 6 there\nwill be no potion fruits on the tree. Regardless of\nhow many nonmagical fruits the tree bears, there\nwill be, at most, two potion fruits on it. Once these\nare picked, there will be no additional potion fruits\n75</p>\n<p>from that tree.\nIf a permanency spell is cast on a magical tree, it\ngrows a continuing series of potion fruits. Once the\ntrees potion fruit is picked, a new one grows in 1d6\ndays. Such a tree will live at least 99 years unless it is\ndestroyed.\nBotanical enchantment is somewhat risky. The\ntree must be tended, watered, and pruned every day\nwhile it is growing. Any severe change in the weather, such as a drought or freeze, will ruin the tree and\nno fruit will be borne. Any use of defiler magic near\nthe tree will kill it and render any potion fruits on it\nRing of Life\nuseless. Even if all goes well, the tree may not bear\npotion fruits, anyway.\nThese new magical items can be found as part of\nlair treasures in Dark Sun. Because they do not appear on the subtables in the DMG, DMs may wish\nto create new tables or use these items when the\nDMs Choice is rolled.\nRod of Divining\nXP Value: 5,000\nThis item scrambles the wearers psionic abilities,\nrendering him incapable of making any psionic\npower checks. The device creates a magical field\naround the wearers mind that does not eliminate\nhis psionic strength points, but interferes with them\nin such a way that they cannot be called upon for\npower checks. The amulet does not interfere with\nthe wearers ability to recover psionic strength\npoints. Only the person who places the amulet\naround someones neck can remove it; if someone\nputs it on himself, they can easily remove it, but if it\nwas placed on by another, the wearer cannot remove\nit without a remove curse or wish spell.\nXP Value: 700\nCrushing such a fruit and rubbing the juices on\nones feet gives the character all the abilities of the\nThis item is a small Y shaped stick that must\nbe held in both hands to use. With each charge expended this item will locate and pull its holder toward any accumulation of water of at least one\ngallon within 1,000 yards. The end of the rod will\npoint toward the water and gently pull the character\nthay way. The quality of the water need not be such\nthat the character can easily obtain it. For instance,\nthe rod might point down to an underground water\nsource up to 1,000 yards beneath the caster. It\nmight also locate moisture within a large plant (if it\namounts to one gallon or more) or that hidden by\ninvisibility or other concealing magic, but it will ignore the moisture within living beings. (Every player\ncharacter holds far more than a gallon of water.) If\nmultiple accumulations of water reside in the rods\nrange, it draws itself to the largest one.\nXP Value: 3,500\nThis item protects the wearer from the effects of\ndefiling magic. When worn, the character is immune to the initiative point loss incurred when in the\ndestructive diameter of a defilers spell. The ring of\nlife also bestows upon its wearer recuperative powers\nas if he had complete bed rest; the wearer naturally\nheals 3 hit points per day. The ring of life will not\nprotect its wearer from the dragons defiling magic.\nXP Value: 500\nwizards spell feather fall, but for a duration of exactly 10 hours. The character can carry with him up\nto 250 pounds of equipment beyond his normal\nclothing and weapons. Oils of feather falling are\nmost often used to travel across the Silt Sea-a person of feather weight can float easily on the surface\nof the silt and walk at his normal rate of movement.\nMultiple applications can last a character long\nenough to cross an estuary of the Silt Sea or even to\nreach one of its many islands from shore.\nNew Magical Items\nAmulet of Psionic Interference\nOil of Feather Falling\n7 6</p>",
