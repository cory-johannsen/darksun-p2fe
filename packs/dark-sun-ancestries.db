They also add one to their initial Intelligence score. However, their intellect is not generally balanced by common sense, so elf characters subtract one from their initial Wisdom score. Finally, elven characters are especially fine-boned and have a high metabolism that tends to tire them out, forcing them to subtract two from their initial Constitution score. Individually, tribal elves are swift, sure, and selfreliant in the extreme. An elf is conditioned to run quickly over sandy and rocky terrain, sometimes for days at a time -an elf warrior can cross better than 50 miles per day. An elven war party on the move is a deadly force of endurance and maneuverability. Elves use no beasts of burden for personal transportation, though they do sometimes engage kanks and similar creatures for baggage or raw materials transport. It is dishonorable among elves to ride on an animal unless wounded and near death-even pregnant women and old elves are expected to keep up with the tribe or be left behind. Elves are all brethren within their own tribe, but regard all outsiders as potential enemies. There is no racial unity among the elves-an elf from outside the tribe is just as much a foe as a human, halfling, or thri-kreen. Acceptance of an outsider by an individual elf can be achieved, but trust will only develop over time. Acceptance of an outsider by an entire tribe is also possible, but rare. It is usually only awarded after some great sacrifice has been made on behalf of the tribe-many outsiders have been accepted posthumously into elven desert tribes. Elves have no special knowledge of secret or concealed doors. They also have no special resistance to spells. Elven infravision enables them to see up to 60 feet in darkness. Elves gain a bonus to surprise opponents when in the wilderness or wastes of Athas. In desert or steppe encounters, when an elf or party of elves approaches a non-elven group, the opponents suffer a penalty of -4 to their surprise rolls. Mixed parties cannot gain this advantage. Elves are masterful warriors, naturally skilled in the use of their long bows and long swords. Elves gain a bonus of +1 to their attack rolls with these weapons, but only those of native tribal make and design. In order to qualify for this bonus, a weapon must be crafted by members of the elfs tribe-no others will do A player character elf can be from a wild, tribal background or from a city state upbringing-there are many elves that have settled in the cities as bazaar vendors, and still many more that have been dragged there in chains. An Athasian elf stands between 6½ and 7½ feet tall. They are slender, lean, and generally in terrific physical condition. Their features are deeply etched into their weather-toughened faces, and their skin made rugged by the windblown sands and baking sun of the wilderness. Elves typically dress to survive in the desert environment. Even when at an oases or in the cities, elves tend to prefer their native garb, designed to wrap the wearer against the brutality of the elements. Elven culture, while savage, is also very rich and diverse. A player character elf can choose from a variety of classes: cleric, defiler, fighter, gladiator, preserver, psionicist, ranger, templar, or thief. In addition, they may select any combination of classes in accordance with the multi-class combinations table presented in the next chapter. The dunes and steppes of Athas are home to thousands of tribes of nomadic elves. While each tribe is very different culturally, the elves within them remain a race of long-limbed sprinters given to theft, raiding, and warfare. to raiding. Elven traders are rightly considered the most capable on Athas. Not only can they barter and deal with a variety of races, they can move and protect their goods across the vast wilderness. 6 Roleplaying: Elves have no great love of creatures outside their tribe. Even when found in the company of others, an elf will keep to himself, often camping near but not directly with his companions. When encountering outsiders, an elf will often fabricate tests of trust and friendship. For instance, an elf might leave a valuable object in the open to see if his new companions attempt to steal it. After a series of such tests, the elf will gradually learn to trust or distrust the outsiders. The severity of these tests of loyalty may take an alarmingly dangerous turn, even revolving around life-threatening situations, before an elf accepts an outsider as an equal. Elves never ride on beasts of burden. They prefer to run everywhere they travel, even when running might prove slower or others in the elfs party will be taking animal or magical transportation.</p>"}, "hp": 8, "size": {"value": "medium"}, "reach": {"value": 5}, "speed": {"value": 30, "otherSpeeds": []}, "boosts": {"0": {"value": ["dexterity"]}, "1": {"value": ["intelligence"]}, "2": {"value": ["free"]}}, "flaws": {"0": {"value": ["constitution"]}}, "languages": {"value": ["Athasian", "Elven"], "custom": ""}, "traits": {"value": ["elf", "humanoid", "dark-sun"], "rarity": "uncommon", "custom": ""}, "vision": {"value": "normal"}, "heritages": [], "additionalFeatures": []}, "effects": [], "flags": {}, "source": {"value": "Chapter Two: Player Character Races"}}

The merchant class, too, is overrun with traders of both races, so it is not at all unusual for children of mixed parentage to be born into the world-the half-elves. 7 elves congregate in great enough numbers to form communities of their own, so they remain outsiders, forever wandering from situation to situation without a people, land, or village to call home. Intolerance, however, has given the half-elf his greatest attribute self-reliance. As a loner, usually without permanent residence, a half-elf survives the rigors of life in the wilderness completely on his own. The skills involved in survival, such as locating food, water, and shelter, are only half of the challenge they face-half-elves must also learn to deal with the absence of companionship, the complete lack of conversation and basic friendship. Coincidentally, faced with intolerance from the races of their parentage, many turn to completely alien races for acceptance. Dwarves, halflings, and even thri-kreen have no basic dislike of half-elvesnor do they grant them any favor. At the very least a half-elf dealing with these races can expect no automatic prejudices. Also, some half-elves turn for companionship to the animal world, training beasts 8 For example, when a half-elf is part of a larger Roleplaying: Half-elves pride themselves on their self-reliance.

The half-elf must spend one week with the animal while it is still young. After that time, the pet will follow the half-elf everywhere and obey simple commands. A half-elf can only have one such pet at a time, and must wait 100 days after the death of one pet to begin training another. Choice of pets is always subject to the DMs approval. Refer to Chapter 11: Encounters for possible pet choices. A half-elf gains the survival proficiency when he reaches 3rd level. He need not spend any of his proficiency slots in order to known survival. Like other characters, half-elves must specify a terrain type for this proficiency. Dark Sun terrain types include stony barrens, sandy wastes, rocky badlands, mountains, scrub plains, forest, salt flats, or boulder fields. A half-elf can befriend one pet when he reaches A half-elf gains some benefits as he increases in levels. A half-elf character can choose from all of the available character classes, though he will have to face eventual level limits in many of them. He can also become multi-classed, having the widest variety of combinations available to him (see the multi-class combinations table in the next chapter).

He will instead hunt for his own food, cook and eat it by himself, away from the others. A half-elf character will discuss strategy with his companions when he has them, and will cooperate as necessary, but will always seem semi-detached and aloof. Despite their self-reliance, when faced with elves or humans, half-elves often find themselves looking for acceptance. For instance, when among elves, a half-elf will go out of his way to prove just how elven he is, by running great distances with them and observing other social and cultural rituals with the elves. These efforts, however, are mostly lost on the elves and therefore serve no purpose. The half-elfs behavior is seen by some as slightly irrational, but only by those who are comfortably wrapped in the blankets of racial acceptance; having none leaves half-elves out in the bitterest cold.</p>"}, "hp": 8, "size": {"value": "medium"}, "reach": {"value": 5}, "speed": {"value": 25, "otherSpeeds": []}, "boosts": {"0": {"value": ["dexterity"]}, "1": {"value": ["free"]}}, "flaws": {"0": {"value": ["constitution"]}}, "languages": {"value": ["Athasian"], "custom": ""}, "traits": {"value": ["half-elf", "humanoid", "dark-sun"], "rarity": "uncommon", "custom": ""}, "vision": {"value": "normal"}, "heritages": [], "additionalFeatures": []}, "effects": [], "flags": {}, "source": {"value": "Chapter Two: Player Character Races"}}

In some lost millennium, as a bizarre experiment or perhaps as some sort of curse, giants were magically crossbred with humans. Half-giants are now fairly common, especially to human controlled lands at the edge of the sea of dust. A half-giant is an enormous individual, standing between 10 and 12 feet tall, and weighing in the neighborhood of 1,600 pounds. Their features are human, but exaggerated. A half-giant character can be a cleric, fighter, gladiator, psionicist, or ranger. Further, a fair array of multi-classed choices are available to half-giant characters, as detailed on the multi-classed combinations chart in the next chapter. Simply put, a half-giant gains terrific size from his giant heritage, but also inherits that races dull wits. His human background, however, provides him with 9 an interest in communication and cooperation, not to mention more reserved traits such as curiosity, a willingness to learn, and a general tendency toward kindness. At any rate, half-giants are capable of far more kindness than their often tyrannical, bloodthirsty giant kin. Strength scores and two to their initial Constitution scores. They subtract two from their initial Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, however. Half-giants double their hit die rolls no matter what their character class. Add any bonus for a high Constitution score after doubling the roll of the die. Though no one knows for certain, half-giants seem to be a fairly young race, perhaps only a few tens of centuries old. There is no half-giant culture common to all of their kind. On the contrary, having insufficient history and overall intelligence to have their own culture, half-giants tend to readily adopt the cultures of other creatures they admire or associate with. Half-giants are very imitative creatures, eager to fit into new situations as they present themselves. All personal items such as clothes, armor, weapons, food, etc., cost double for half-giant characters. Other considerations, such as transportation or lodging, are also considerably more expensive when they are available at all. In areas not dominated by half-giants, things such as buildings, furniture, wagons, boats, etc. arent made to support their weight. Even in cities, they tend to camp outside to avoid destroying things. Roleplaying: Half-giants are friendly and eager to Half-giants sometimes collect into communities of their own, though they most often adopt the culture and customs of those creatures that are nearby. When near an elven nation, for instance, halfgiants will form their own hunting and raiding parties, adopting the ways of the elven marauders. They wont mix with the elves, neither will they fight with them. In most instances, imitative half-giant communities will compete directly with the race whom they are likening themselves to. It is their great size and combat prowess that keeps their competitors at a safe distance. please those they meet. Others who accept them find that half-giants quickly adopt their lifestyles and skills, even their values. A half-giant character who is presented with a new situation should examine the roles of the people there, determine where he might best fit in, and then start performing the tasks necessary. For example, a half-giant character who happens upon a dwarven stone quarry may watch the dwarves, then start quarrying stone himself. He wont work with the dwarves, necessarily but, if he can make a living at it, he will continue to quarry stone just like his neighbor dwarves do. Half-giants can switch their attitudes very quickly, taking on new values to fit new situations. A halfgiant whose peaceful farming life is disrupted by marauders may soon adopt the morals of the very renegades who sacked his village. To reflect this, one aspect of a half-giants alignment must be fixed, and chosen during character creation. The other half must be chosen when they awaken each morning. They are only bound to that alignment until they sleep again. (See Chapter 4, Alignment). For example, a half-giant may have a fixed lawful alignment. Every morning, he must choose to be lawful good, lawful neutral, or lawful evil. This is not to say, however, that half-giants are strictly bound to perform as those they see around them, nor are they restricted from moving on. On the contrary, if the situation is not beneficial or if the half-giant would not perform well (living in the trees like the halflings, for instance), he wont imitate it. Also, half-giants are not bound to a piece of work or a lifestyle the way other races arethey seldom have regrets or reminiscences about what has gone before. They simply arent as emotionally attached to their lives or works. Half-giant characters add four to their initial Persons playing a half-giant character should be 10 prepared to switch goals and lifestyles easily, usually based on the charismatic individuals their character meets.

Beyond the Ringing Mountains are jungles that flourish in rains that never reach the tablelands or the Sea of Silt. There life is abundant, the foliage thick and untamed. The undisputed rulers of these jungles are the halflings. On a personal level, halflings relate very well to one another, well enough to have built a considerable culture rich in art, song, and other expressive communication. However, they tend to rely heavily on their culture for communication, a culture that both parties in a conversation are assumed to understand.

However, those riches belong to the land and, in the mind of the halfling, should never be moved away. For instance, nature intended a spring to bring water only to a certain area. To move the water through irrigation to some other area is not what nature had in mind. Similarly, an archaeological find in the jungle that yields a great pile of gold and metals is an event that shouldnt be tampered with-the gold might be used to raise a spectacular series of clerical buildings on the spot, but it should not be carted off to some other location. To quell their own confusion, their curiosity demands that they attempt to learn many of the customs of those they confront on the outside world. This is not to say that a halfling character will adopt these customs. On the contrary, they will almost certainly not, but a wide variety of experience is encouraged by the clerical teachings of halfling witch doctorsthey see the customs of others as no threat to their own and as a welcome chance to learn through a different point of view. in their own groups. While not afraid to adventure on their own among other races, they tend to have a difficult time adjusting to other customs and points of view. However, being generally open-minded, rather than becoming abrasive or combative, halflings tend to be curious and, at times, utterly confused by the behavior of others. Halfling culture is fabulously diverse, but difficult for other races to comprehend. A complete history of their culture, if such a thing existed, would speak volume upon volume of complex social change, inspirational clerical leaders, and in-depth personal studies of the halfling and his duty to his jungle home. Conspicuous in their absence would be references to great wars of conquest or tremendous monetary wealth-the yardsticks by which other races measure cultural success. Halfling culture cares for the individuals inward being, his identity and spiritual unity with his race and environment. Their culture does not provide for more traditional values, and vices such as greed and avarice are particularly discouraged. Roleplaying: Halflings are very comfortable when As mentioned in the Players Handbook, halflings with a Strength score of 18 never roll for exceptional strengthwhile they may be quite strong, their small size precludes them attaining the muscle mass or leverage to apply tremendous strength. Due to their small size, halfling characters subtract two from their initial Strength score and one from their initial Constitution score. Also, their introverted nature means they subtract one from their initial Charisma score. However, halflings are possessed of tremendous speed and agility, and so add two points to their initial Dexterity score. Finally, their pious unity with their race and their jungle environment grants them an additional two points to their initial Wisdom score. in conversation for a listener who isnt intimately familiar with halfling culture, and as such they easily become frustrated with outsiders. Depending upon how official a meeting is, outsiders often have to take great pains to learn local customs merely to communicate with the halflings in question. Of course, halflings who have travelled widely outside their traditional jungle home have a much greater tolerance of those with a lack of halfling culture; so much so that they can communicate easily and without frustration. nents that are described in the Players Handbook.

The differences may be An average human male stands between 6 and 6½ feet tall and weighs 180 to 200 pounds. A human female is somewhat smaller, averaging between 5½ and 6 feet in height and weighing between 100 and 140 pounds. The colors of skin, eyes, and hair vary widely. Humans are the predominant race on Athas. Human characters are not restricted in either the classes they can choose or the levels they can attain. High-level humans can easily become the most powerful characters in the campaign. Although humans can not be multi-classed characters, they can be dual class characters as described in the Players Handbook. When among others of his kind, a halfling will never cross or lie to his brethren. They will help each other in times of need, regardless of danger.

Ultimately, none of them will give him any benefit nor any hindrance to game play-his appearance is strictly a roleplaying asset. The children of humans and other races produce the so-called half-races: half-elves and muls.

Where other, less tolerant races come into contact with one another, humans often serve as diplomatic buffers. Mul A mul (pronounced: mül) is an incredibly tough crossbreed of a human and dwarf. They retain the height and cunning of their human parent, plus the durability and raw strength of their dwarven heritage. Muls are usually the products of the slave pits-owners recognize the muls assets as gladiators and laborers, and so order the births of as many muls as can be managed within the ranks of their slaves. Muls are born sterilethey cannot perpetuate their kind. A full-grown mul stands 6 to 6½ feet tall and weighs 240-300 pounds. They are fair skinned, sometimes tending toward a copperish coloration. Their dwarven ancestry gives them a well-muscled frame and an incredible constitutionmul laborers can perform heavy work for days at a time without stopping. Muls have stern facial features.

Players and DMs familiar with the AD&D game will find that these restrictions are very different in DARK SUN campaign setting, however, beguage and communication. For instance, the thrikreen language is a combination of clicks and whines that come very natural to their pincered mouths-humans find it very difficult to reproduce these sounds, but the task is not impossible. DARK SUN adventures are not quite as language friendly as other AD&D® campaign worlds-characters will tend to rely more heavily upon magic or interpreters for communication. As a reminder, the DARK SUN campaign assumes that players and DMs are making use of the optional proficiency system detailed in the AD&D game. cause of the unusual nature of the demihuman races. Humans are always unrestricted in level advancement or class selection. It is recommended that the optional rule on Exceeding Level Limits (presented in the Dungeon Masters Guide) be used when playing a DARK SUN campaign. The Common Tongue There is a standard language (known simply as Languages common or the common tongue) that all humans, dwarves, elves, half-elves and muls speak. It is important to note that halflings and thri-kreen do not speak common. It is strongly recommended, however, that player character halflings and thri-kreen use one of their proficiency slots to obtain the common tongue. Athas is a world where the intelligent races come from a wide variety of speciesthe humans and demihumans are very different than the insectmen and beastmen. Each intelligent race has its own language, sometimes even its own approach to lanTable 3: Racial Class And Level Limits Class</p>"}, "hp": 12, "size": {"value": "medium"}, "reach": {"value": 5}, "speed": {"value": 25, "otherSpeeds": []}, "boosts": {"0": {"value": ["strength"]}, "1": {"value": ["constitution"]}, "2": {"value": ["free"]}}, "flaws": {"0": {"value": ["charisma"]}}, "languages": {"value": ["Athasian"], "custom": ""}, "traits": {"value": ["mul", "humanoid", "dark-sun"], "rarity": "uncommon", "custom": ""}, "vision": {"value": "normal"}, "heritages": [], "additionalFeatures": []}, "effects": [], "flags": {}, "source": {"value": "Chapter Two: Player Character Races"}}

The rigors of their upbringing in bondage makes them sullen and difficult to befriendmul Hulking insect-men standing as tall as 7 feet at the shoulder, the thri-kreen are the least human of the player character races. Their survivability in the wilderness, combined with their cunning and intellect, have made the mantis warriors (as they are known to some races) the undisputed masters across large tracts of the Athasian wastes. The individual thri-kreen is a six-limbed creature A player character mul may become a cleric, druid, fighter, gladiator, psionicist, or thief. When created, the player must decide if his mul character will be considered a demihuman or a human character. As a human, the mul character can have unlimited advancement in any class and become a dual-classed character later in his career. As a demihuman, a mul can become a multi-classed character in accordance with the multi-classed combinations table in the next chapter. Once the decision is made, the mul character will forever be considered either a human or demihuman in all ways. A mul character adds two to his initial Strength Like their dwarven parent, a mul who sets his mind on freedom or disruption among the other slaves is rarely kept on hand. They most often are sold or traded from owner to dissatisfied owner until they are eventually relegated to harsh labor in a remote area or sent to the gladiator pits. stated. won their freedom and now live independent lives all over Athas. Of these, a large percentage have bartered their combat prowess, making their way as soldiers or guards. A few others, given to more cerebral pursuits, have turned to priestly devotions or the mental disciplines of psionics. bad a deal. Of course, when their arena or work performance is lacking, discipline is cruelly reinThus, they often dont see their slavery as all that taskmasters whip taking the place of parents and family, muls are given to a gruff personality and vialent reactions. Understandably, many never seek friends or companionship but live out their lives in servitude, driven by hatred and spite. Most, however, learn who to trust in the slave pits and who not to, gaining favor and reputation among the other slaves. Many slave muls have either escaped or otherwise Mules are able to work longer and harder without rest than are most other races. Regardless of the preceding type of exertion, eight hours of sleep will let a mul become fully rested, ready to begin work again. Roleplaying: Muls are slaves, true, but when they are doing well in the arena, they are the most pampered slaves. It is expensive to generate and maintain a stable of muls, and their owners protect their large investments with special treatment and considerations. Its rare that a mul who does his work well receives particularly harsh treatment as a slave. characters subtract two from their initial Charisma scores. Type of Exertion 24 + Con hours 36 + Con hours 48 + Con hours Con days 15 A thri-kreens head has two large eyes, two antennae, and a small-but-powerful jaw. The jaws work from side to side and have several small extensions that grab and manipulate food while it is being eaten. The eyes are jet black and multi-faceted, separated to either side of the head. The antennae are all but vestigial, serving only to help maneuver through brush and grasslands in the darkness (they also serve to lessen any darkness or blindness based penalty by 1 point (or 5%)ranged activities (like missile combat) do not gain this benefit). with a tough, sandy-yellow exoskeleton. Its hind legs are the most powerful, used for walking, running, and leaping. The four forward limbs each have a hand with three fingers and an opposable thumb. A thri-kreens exoskeleton is extremely hard, and gives the creature a base armor class of 5. Thri-kreen have no need of sleep. Thri-kreen characters can remain active through the day and night. Thri-kreen make and use a variety of weapons. Chief among them are the gytha, a polearm with wicked blades at either end, and the chatkcha, a crystalline throwing wedge. They also fashion many forms of clothing, but never wear armor. Thri-kreen can use most magical items such as wands, rods, staves, weapons, shields, and most miscellaneous magic. Those items, however, designed to be worn by demihumans, such as rings, girdles, armor, and cloaks, will not function for a thri-kreen because he simply cannot put them on. Unless otherwise stated, magical items are designed for use by demihumans. The pack is the single unit of organization among the thri-kreen, generally having 2-24 individuals. The pack is always on the hunt, never idlethere are no permanent thri-kreen communities. The socalled thri-kreen nations are, in fact, not organized as such, nor are they thought of as nations by the mantis warriors. The nations are human conventions to delineate on maps where the thri-kreen thrive and dominate. 16 Thri-kreen are carnivores and the pack is constantly on the hunt for food. They consider the other player character races as potential food stock, but only prey on other intelligent creatures in times of desperation. The mantis warriors have a well-known taste for elves, which keeps both races at an uneasy peace when they are forced to cooperate. Thri-kreen player characters can become clerics, druids, fighters, gladiators, psionicists, or rangers. They may also be multi-classed (see multi-classed combinations in the next chapter). Regardless of his class, a thri-kreen gains certain advantages as he increases in experience levels. A thri-kreen has formidable natural attacks. They are able to make one bite and four claw attacks per round. Each claw strikes for 1d4 points of damage, and the bite inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. If using a weapon, the thri-kreen can attack with its weapon and bite; multiple attacks due to fighter level only apply to the weapon. A thri-kreen can leap up and forward when he reaches 3rd level. The thri-kreen can leap 20 feet straight up or up to 50 feet straight forward. They cannot leap backward. A thri-kreen can use a venomous saliva against opponents when he reaches 5th level. Those struck by the thri-kreens bite must save vs. paralyzation or be paralyzed; smaller than man-sized creatures are paralyzed for 2d10 rounds, man-sized for 2d8 rounds, and larger for 1d8 rounds. Creatures classified as huge or gargantuan are only affected for one round. A thri-kreen masters the use of the chatkcha, a crystal throwing wedge, when he reaches 5th level. Other Characteristics The chatkcha can be thrown up to 30 yards and still return to the thrower if it misses the target. When it hits, a chatkcha inflicts 1d6+2 points of damage. In game terms, a thri-kreen gains an automatic bonus proficiency in chatkcha on reaching 5th level. If he has previously spent a proficiency slot on chatkcha, the thri-kreen gains nothing for reaching 5th level. A thri-kreen can dodge missiles fired at it on a roll of 3 or better on 1d20 when he reaches 7th level. He cannot dodge magical effects, only physical missiles. Magical missile weapons (enchanted arrows, thrown axes, etc.) modify this roll by their plus. Thri-kreen add one to their initial Wisdom score and add two to their initial Dexterity scores. Their intellect and behavior are such that they subtract one from their initial Intelligence score and subtract two from their initial Charisma score. Roleplaying: A thri-kreens obsession is the hunt. Thri-kreen are skilled and wise hunters-skilled enough to bring down the animals they need, wise enough to move on before they completely deplete an area of prey. From birth, all thri-kreen are involved in the huntthe young are concerned with preparation and preservation of hunted food, elders are hunters. There are no distinctions between male and female thri-kreen in their pack society. Their pack intelligence also makes them protective of their clutch-mates. To a thri-kreen, his clutch or pack includes whoever he is with at the time of danger. It is instinctive for a thri-kreen to leap into battle to protect those he is with, regardless of personal danger. To outsiders, thri-kreen sometimes seem overly preoccupied with gathering food, hunting, and maintaining stocks of travel food. Since they do not sleep, thri-kreen often hunt through the night while other races they are working with are needlessly lying around. As has been said, Dark Sun characters are very different from those in other AD&D® games.
