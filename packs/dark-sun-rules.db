The three books, when taken together, present a new adventure style known as a\nflip-book.\nThis book, called the Story Book, contains a\nshort story of the same name (which, presumably,\nyouve just read), this introduction to the adventure,\nand two monstrous compendium style pages for\nmonsters peculiar to the scenario. The spiral bound\nbooks are the Dungeon Masters Book and the\nPlayer Aid Cards.\nThe dungeon master should keep the Story Book\nand the Dungeon Masters Book in his possession.\nThe Player Aid Cards are for the players to view\nduring the adventure, but only as directed by the\ndungeon \nmaster.\nThe Short Story\nThe Flip Books\nJerry Oltions A Little Knowledge, serves as an\nintroduction to the scenario, both for you and your\nplayers. It doesnt tell the story of the adventure, so\nit doesnt give anything away-let any of the players\nread it beforehand, if theyre interested. The characters in the short story are not the main characters\nof the adventure, nor do they even appear as\nNPCs. The role-playing adventure basically begins\nas the short story is winding down. In this case, the\nplayer characters are other slaves in the caravan\nwagon. They may or may not have been privy to the\nactivities described in the short story, but thatdoesnt matter. Now they are about to be abandoned in the desert to fend for themselves, and\nthats the focus of the role-playing adventure.\nCharacters\nThe role-playing adventure is recommended for\nfour to eight players, all of whom should be third\nlevel (that is, novice characters). DMs should suggest to the players that at least one of the characters\nbe a psionicist. With that in mind, the players are\nfree to generate any characters they wish. For better\nrole-playing, the DM should also have them fabricate some reason that they are now slaves on this\nwagon. For instance, a dwarven gladiator could\nhave been ordered to win a crucial fight, or else\nwhen he lost he was thrown into slavery. Remember,\nnone of the players characters are the main characters in the short story.\nThe player characters will have no equipment and\nno money with them-thus, that portion of character generation can be skipped. Any materials they\nwish to use during the adventure will have to be\nscavenged as they go.\nIt is not important that the player characters know\nof each other before the adventure begins. In fact,\ngiven the situation at the start of the adventure, its\nreasonable to assume that they are meeting each\nother for the first time as this adventure begins.\nThe two spiral bound books contain the roleplaying adventure. The information for every encounter is condensed on a single page that the DM\ncan look at and reference quickly. The players also\nget a series of cards with maps or illustrations right\nat their fingertips, to use and refer to at their leisure,\nnot stuffed away in a book that the DM needs to\nuse, too.\nThe Player Aid Cards contain illustrations and\ndiagrams that coincide with the encounters of the\nadventure. The Dungeon Masters Book contains\nthe text and direction needed to referee the adventure. It provides background, role-playing notes,\nand game statistics for every encounter, spelling out\nfor the DM everything he needs to know to effectively run the player characters through that encounter.\nEach card in the Dungeon Masters Book covers\none encounter in the adventure. That information is\norganized in the following sections:\nSetup. This section tells the DM how to prepare\nfor the upcoming encounter. It may contain infor13</p>\n<p>mation on pacing, instruct the players to flip to a\ncertain card in their book, or give the DM other\nvital information.\nActions. The various actions on the cards in the\nDungeon Masters Book are self explanatory. Each\nRules References\none details a certain portion of the encounter on the\ncard. There may be one or more action sections per\ncard.\nRoleplaying. These notes are given to enhance roleplaying, both by the DM and on the part of the\nplayers. The DARK SUN  Boxed Set is intended\nfor advanced roleplayers, those who are familiar\nwith both the AD&D 2nd Edition game and the\nnuances of effective roleplaying. Incorporate the roleplaying notes when appropriate through the entire\nencounter. There may not be a roleplaying section\nfor every encounter.\nStatistics. This section provides game statistics for\nevery creature that might be fought or otherwise\nConcluding the Adventure\ndealt with in the encounter. Ability scores, combat\nstatistics, spell and psionics lists, and experience\npoints earned are all presented. When there is treasure to be found, it will also be listed here.\nNext. Once a particular encounter is concluded,\nthis section tells the DM where to go next. It may\nalso give some hints as to pacing; some encounters\nare extremely important and should, therefore, be\ngiven sufficient play time. Others that are less important should be speeded up to maintain player interest in the adventure.\nThe encounters provided here are balanced for\nan adventuring party of the size and experience\nlevels recommended. However, since this is an introductory adventure, its important that the players at\nleast touch upon every encounter presented in the\nadventure (they dont have to overcome every obstacle, but they should at least confront every one). If\nthe player characters are becoming weaker and may\nnot survive to the end of the adventure, the DM\nshould modify the encounters to make them less seThe various cards used in this adventure describe\nmany NPCs, locations, and situations that wont\nchange after this adventure is long ended. Keep the\ncards available for when the PCs pass this way\nagain. Who knows? They could easily meet up with\nold friends or enemies, and youll have all the appropriate information ready to go.\nAfter card #24 in the Dungeon Masters Book,\nthe adventure is over. At that point, the player characters will have experienced first hand many of the\nthings that make Athas wastelands both interesting and deadly. What the players decide to do with\ntheir characters then is wide open-new encounters\nand adventures will take place outside the direction\nof the flip-books. Resume traditional roleplaying\ntechniques for adventures following A Little Knowledge.\nThe adventure in A Little Knowledge centers on\nsurvival in an arid environment.

Jedra,\nbusy haggling over the price of a new waterskin,\nflinched as the bright blue flash illuminated the\nfood and clothing and harness stands around him.\nIn the same instant, a thunderclap rattled the entire\nbazaar and echoed off the adobe brick walls of the\none- and two-story buildings surrounding it.\nJedra turned, ears ringing, to see a four-slave sedan chair on the ground only a few yards away, the\noverweight templar it had carried angrily brushing\nsand off his black robe of office while three heavily\nmuscled slaves frantically righted the chair. The\nfourth slave lay on the ground, a patch of melted\nsand a few inches across bubbling beside his smoking body.\nThe slave must have stumbled and pitched the\ntemplar out, Jedra supposed, and the templar had\nkilled him for it. Case closed.\nActivity had stopped in the bazaar, but as others\ncame to the same conclusion it picked up again. Jedra turned back to the water vendor, a leathery old\nelf with an eyepatch over his left eye, and said, All\nright, two ceramics for the waterskin, but only if its\nfull.\nThe elf peered at Jedra, no doubt trying to judge\nhow far he could push this young, skinny half-elf,\nbut at last he nodded. Done, he said, and he\nfilled the teardrop-shaped leather sack from a barrel\nat the back of his stand, careful not to spill a single\ndrop, while Jedra dug into his pouch for two fragments of ceramic coin. They were the last of Jedras\nmoney. If he was to eat today, he would have to find\nwork or scavenge something he could sell.\nTaking the skin from the elf, he drained a fourth\nof its contents in two long swallows, then slung it\naround his shoulder by the strap, the weight of it\ncomforting. At least he wouldnt go thirsty today.\nThe templar was already gone when he turned\naround again, as was the sedan chair and the slaves\nbody. All that remained of the incident was the\nsmall glassy pool where the lightning bolt had melted the sand. Ever curious, Jedra kicked at it with the\ntoe of his sandal, and a piece of glass flaked off the\ntop. It was several inches across and an inch or so\nthick in the middle, but thinner around the edges.\nHe bent down and picked up the fragment, then\nnearly dropped it again when he looked into it.\nThere, amid the bubbles and streaks, danced a tiny\nPage I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The actual creature\nstood across the way, its six-limbed, mantislike insectile body glistening in the sunlight as it examined a\ngythkaa polearm with blades at either end-at an\narmorers stall.\nThe thri-kreen seemed oblivious to Jedra and his\nglass. Cautiously, lest he be less fortunate a second\ntime, Jedra looked through the glass again, turning\nslowly and watching as the upside-down bazaar slid\nby-backward. No one noticed that they had been\nturned on their heads, if indeed they had. Jedra put\nhis free hand out beyond the glass to see if he could\nfeel any sensation.\nA point of bright light slid across his wrist, and\nwhen he paused to look at it, he felt a sudden sting\nof heat. The glass had burned him!\nJedra rubbed at his wrist, but he smiled. The\nglass must still hold a bit of the lightning bolt that\nhad created it. That might be worth something to\nthe right person. He glanced at a spice stand\ndraped with herbs and roots, a stand that was rumored to be a black market outlet for the things\nused in the creation of magic. The proprietor would\nprobably buy the glass from him.\nHe took a few steps toward the stand, then\nstopped, realizing he was reluctant to part with his\nnew treasure so soon. A half-breed elf with no home\nand no magical training didnt often find himself in\npossession of wondrous devices. He had no doubt\nhe would have to sell it eventually, but the day was\nstill young and his hunger was still bearable. He\nwould see what else the glass could do first.\nHe found a quiet spot just off the bazaar, in an alley\nlined with continuous mud-brick row houses. Their\nwooden doors and windows were closed tight to hold\nin the cool air from the previous night, giving Jedra\nprivacy to experiment.\nIn just a few minutes he discovered the glasss major power, and the reason hed been burned: When\nheld at the right distance, it made things seem\ngreater than they really were, including the heat of\nAthass coppery red sun. Why most things remained only images while the sun actually seemed to\nappear beneath the glass was a mystery, as was the\nreason why objects beyond arms reach of the glass\nwere turned upside-down.\nHe had just ignited a dead leaf-no doubt blown\ninto the alley from the kings garden, since few of\nthe freemen living in the row houses would willingly\nspend the water to keep a plant alive-when he felt a\npresence in his mind, as if someone were watching\nhim. He had learned to trust that sensation; he\nlooked up to see a human nobleman of about sixty\nyears, his hair as white as his robe, standing at the\nfar end of the alley, mouth open in astonishment.\nJust as obviously, Jedra was not a templar, and by\nlaw only templars and the sorcerer-king himself were\nallowed to use magic. A commoner caught practicing it could be sold into slavery, even executed. Unused to magic or its implications, Jedra hadnt even\nconsidered that danger.\nCursing his carelessness, Jedra stood and began to\nwalk quickly toward the bazaar again. The man\nmust have seen the leaf bursting into flame and\nwould certainly draw the obvious conclusion that Jedra was using the glass to power some sort of magic.\nHe considered it now. Suddenly sweating, he\nsprinted for the bazaar, hoping to lose himself in the\ncrowd, but he had hardly made it a dozen paces\nbefore the noble found his voice. The shout of\nStop him! pursued Jedra out of the alley, and he\nemerged to find everyone looking in his direction.\nNone of the dozens of shoppers made a move to\ncatch him, probably thinking him an ordinary thief,\nbut when the noble emerged from the alley behind\nhim and shouted, A magician! Stop him! they\nsprang into action.\nA tall, massive half-giant with arms the size of Jedras legs swung a sack of grain off one shoulder\njust as Jedra ran past, catching him square in the\nback with it. He staggered forward under the blow\nbut kept his footing, only to slam into a compact,\nmusclebound dwarf. The dwarfs blocky head\nreached only to Jedras chest, just high enough to\nburst his new waterskin with the impact.\nHe dodged around the dwarf, but the entire bazaar seemed out to get him now. A nobles order\nwas almost as good as law, especially an order the\ntemplars would so obviously support. None of the\ncrowd wished to be caught disobeying that order lest\nthey be accused of aiding in an escape. Such people\noften found themselves sharing their quarrys fate.\nJedra whirled and leaped back into the alley,\ndodging dwarf and half-giant and bowling over the\n2</p>\n<p>Jerry Oltion\nnoble, but he skidded to a stop when he realized\nthat the nobles cry had brought people running\nfrom the other end, too. He was trapped. He looked\nto either side but saw only the closed doors and\nshuttered windows of the row houses lining the alley.\nCould he leap to a windowsill and from there to a\nroof? Not likely, but he could think of nothing else\nto try. He crouched to spring, but when he jumped\nit felt as if hed kicked a hole in the ground rather\nthan launched himself into action. He heard astonished gasps from the crowd and looked down to see\na shimmering circle of darkness beneath his feet. He\nhad just enough time to scream before he fell\nthrough.\nHe landed on his feet on hard-packed dirt, but the\nremains of his abortive leap and a sudden rush of\ndisorientation combined to send him sprawling. He\nthrew out his hands to stop his fall, and the glass\nflew from his grasp to skitter to a stop in a circle of\nash next to a pair of dark leather boots.\nStraining to see in the dim light, Jedra raised his\nhead to find who the boots belonged to. A short,\nwiry man with dark curly hair stood before him. The\nman bent down to pick up the glass.\ntook stock of his surroundings, though the circle of\nash around the mans feet told him plenty. He was a\nmagician, and not a templar, either. Templars drew\ntheir power from the citys sorcerer-king, but other\nmagicians had to draw upon the life-force around\nthem. Every time a magician cast a spell, he drew his\nenergy from the plant life and fertile soil around\nhim. If a mage wasnt careful, he drew all the lifeforce from an area, reducing it to ash.\nWho are you? asked Jedra as he stood and\nThe man didnt answer. He examined the glass\ncarefully, nearly dropping it when he saw upsidedown images of the room slide through it. Oho!\nhe said. So this is what caused all the commotion.\nIs it your work?\nJedra had no idea how to respond. He looked\naround him and saw that he was in a one-room\nhouse, with a cot in one corner, a plank table and\ntwo chairs in another, a wooden chest and cabinet in\na third, and a workbench covered with scrolls and\nwands and unfamiliar tools in the fourth. A window\nin one wall opened onto a shared courtyard and allowed a shaft of sunlight to illuminate the room.\nThe window in the opposite wall was shuttered, but\nJedra could hear the mob shouting in confusion just\nbeyond it. Obviously, the man had rescued him with\nsome kind of spell, but for what reason Jedra\ncouldnt guess. Finally he simply said, Maybe.\nGood answer, the man said. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Dornal, mage and member of\nthe Veiled Alliance.\nJedra considered making up a name, but there\nseemed little point in lying to a mage. Jedra, he\nsaid.\nDornal smiled. I was right to rescue you, Jedra.\nYou have powers the Alliance would love to learn.\nYou have heard of us, havent you?\nJedra nodded. Of course he had. The Veiled Alliance was supposedly a league of mages opposed to\nthe sorcerer-king and his templars and to unscrupulous magicians in general. They worked to put lifeforce back into the world rather than use it up to\npower their spells. They were a secretive bunch\nwhose existence Jedra had only half believed until\nnow.\nI was looking through the shutter when I saw\nyou practicing your burning spell, said Dornal as\nhe squinted to see the images in the glass. I assume this is used for that as well? He swung\naround toward the open window.\nDont look at the sun!\nThe mage lowered the glass and studied Jedra\nfrom beneath narrowed brows.\nIt magnifies things. Even sunlight. You could\nburn your eye with it.\nOh. Dornal examined the glass with renewed\ninterest. And what were you doing with it?\nExperimenting.\nOf \ncourse.\nA subtle change in the noise from outside made\nDornal step to the window and peer through the\ncracks in the shutter, then he turned suddenly away.\nTheyve brought in templars to search the area for\nmagic. Weve got to go. He walked to the cabinet,\npulled out a cloth traveling bag, and began to throw\nclothing and valuables into it. The lightning glass\nwent into the bag, Jedra noticed.\nGo where? he asked.\nWe must leave the city for a time, said Dornal.\nI risked a great deal in stealing you away right out\nin the open like that. Templars can trace the use of\n3</p>\n<p>A Little Knowledge\nmagic, and they dont like to be publicly thwarted;\ntheyll search for us for many days before they give\nup.\nDays!\nThats right. So we would be wise to stay out of\ntheir path until that time passes. Dornal pulled a\nlong, multi-colored tunic from the cabinet and\ntossed it to Jedra. Here, put that on.\nJedra complied, seeing the wisdom in that, at\nleast. He was about to argue about the idea of leaving the city when Dornal tossed him a leather sack\nand said, Keep that out of sight.\nJedra nearly collapsed when he opened it and saw\na double-handful of silver and gold coins. Hed never before held even a single silver piece. A fortune\nthis size would take him a dozen lifetimes to earn,\nand at least a lifetime to spend. If Dornal trusted\nsomeone hed just met with such wealth, then the\nman must be a powerful mage indeed. And if so,\nthen he certainly knew more about keeping himself\ns a f e  f r o m  t e m p l a r s  t h a n  J e d r a  d i d .  T h e  b o y\nstripped off his ruined water-skin and used its tie to\nsecure the money bag around his neck, making certain it hung hidden beneath his tunic.\nDornal tossed another money sack into his traveling bag, tied it closed, and stepped to the back door.\nComing? \nhe \nasked.\nJedra couldnt see that he had much choice, not\nif the templars were looking for him. I guess, he\nsaid, and followed the mage out the door.\nWithin hours he found himself sharing a cramped\ncabin in an upper deck of a merchant caravan headed for the city of Tyr. It was hardly a caravan, really,\njust a single enormous wooden wagon pulled by two\nequally enormous mekillotslong, wide, lizardlike\ncreatures with hide thick enough to turn arrows.\nThe wagon they drew looked like a castle on rollers,\ncomplete with battlements from which guards could\nfire on the raiders and wild beasts that roamed the\ndesert. Inside was a warren of decks and compartments with enough cargo capacity to hold an entire\nbazaars worth of goods.\nThis wagons cargo also included slaves, destined\nto labor and probably die on the ziggurat being\nbuilt for the sorcerer-king of Tyr. Jedra shuddered\nwhen he thought of the poor creatures huddled in\ndarkness just a few decks below his own. Had it not\nDornal was obviously testing him. Carefully Jedra described how the templar called down the\nlightning bolt and how he had found the glass afterward.\nA lightning spell, Dornal mused when he was\ndone. Yes, I suppose there might be enough energy in a lightning spell to make something like this,\nbut if the templar didnt fashion it on purpose, then\nI dont suppose he knows anything more about it\nthan you do.\nProbably not.\nIt doesnt seem to need life-force to power it,\nhe said. Truly astonishing. What else does it do?\nYou saw how it magnifies things, Jedra said.\nHe was sitting on the edge of the cabins single\nbunk, trying to keep from getting sick with the swaying of the wagon.\nYes, yes,\nand it makes distant things look\nsmaller and upside-down, said Dornal. I fail to\nsee the usefulness of that, unless you could actually\nmake something become smaller and upside-down.\nIs there a spell for that, perhaps?\nI dont know, Jedra said. I dont think so.\nYou dont think so. Dornal peered at Jedra\nthrough the glass. You know, its becoming quite\nclear to me that you know very little about this . . .\nthis device. You didnt make it yourself, did you?\nJedra had been dreading this moment. He considered lying, but he knew hed be caught in an instant. Reluctantly he said, No. But I saw how it\nwas made.\nDid you now? Tell me about it. What spells\nwere used?\nThey also needed the sunlight the window admitted. Dornal was examining Jedras mysterious piece\nof glass, holding it up to the light and branding lines\ninto the tiny tabletop jutting out from the opposite\nwall.\nbeen for Dornals intervention,\nhe might have\nfound himself in a similar situation.\nThe dry, musky smell of mekillot hide poured in\nthrough the single foot-square porthole in their\ncabin, but closing the shutter would have been\nworse. Theyd only just left the city, but Jedra was\nalready sweating with the heat and he knew it would\nget much worse as the day wore on. They needed all\nthe fresh air they could get, even if it did smell of\ndust and lizard.\n4</p>\n<p>Jerry Oltion\nAnd you know next to nothing. Youre not a\nmage at all, are you?\nNo, Jedra admitted. Hopefully, he added,\nBut I bet I could learn.\nDornal laughed softly, and his laugh sent a chill\ndown Jedras spine. Oh, no doubt you could.\nYouve got potential. I can sense it in you. But I see\nno point in training my own competition. He\nwaved an arm, and Jedra felt his muscles lock into\nplace. The wagon lurched, one of its wheels no\ndoubt falling into a circle of ash that suddenly appeared beneath it as the magician above cast his\nspell. Unable to keep his balance, Jedra toppled to\nhis side on the bunk.\nWith effort, he could still speak. What are you\ndoing? he demanded.\nRetrieving whats mine. Dornal knelt beside\nJedra and removed the money bag from beneath\nthe boys tunic. Thank you for carrying this past\nthe gate guards for me, he said, pouring into his\nhand a collection of crystals and amulets that would\nhave marked anyone as a magician on sight. I\nwasnt sure wed make it past them unchallenged.\nDornal had cast some kind of illusion on the bag,\nJedra realized. He kicked at the magician with all\nhis strength, but his spell-bound leg hardly moved.\nYou used me, he hissed.\nI did. Get used to it. Its going to happen a lot\nwhere youre going.\nWheres that?\nFor answer, Dornal merely pointed downward.\nThen he waved his hand again, and Jedra lost consciousness entirely.\nJedra woke to intense heat and the smell of dozens\nof sweaty, unwashed bodies. The only light came\nfrom two barred windows set in doors on either end\nof the hold, the doors themselves opening only into\ndim companionways, but the boy didnt need light\nto know where he was. Dornal had sold him into\nslavery, probably for little more than the cost of his\npassage. Hed taken back his tunic, too; Jedra now\nwore a simple breechcloth.\nHe sat up and looked around him. There were\ntwenty or thirty others in the hold with him, all\nbound at wrists and ankles with heavy leather manacles and tied to the wall with ropes attached to the\ncollars around their necks. Jedra saw that the slavemaster hadnt been picky; there were humans,\ndwarves, an elf, even one of the insectile thri-kreen.\nWhat did you do, cross the wagon master? a\nfemale voice asked. He turned and saw a short,\nround-faced human woman sitting beside him. She\nwore a halter in addition to her breechcloth.\nI trusted a magician, he said after a moment.\nShe laughed, but not unkindly. Not a wise\nidea , she said.\nA dwarf two people beyond her did laugh unkindly, but not at Jedra. In a voice like distant thunder he said, You should talk, templar.\nThe other slaves laughed. Jedra stared at the\nw o m a n  i n  o p e n  a m a z e m e n t .  S h e ,  a  t e m p l a r ?\nWrong, she said to the dwarf. I was a healer.\nMy powers are psionic, not magical, and to be a\ntemplar youve got to know magic.\nJedra knew next to nothing about psionics, the\nmental abilities that some people could call upon instead of magic, save that such powers supposedly\ndidnt require life-energy to fuel them. He had wondered if his own ability to know when people were\nwatching him was psionic, but hed never before\nfound anyone who could tell him.\nHe was about to ask the woman beside him, but\nthe dwarf wasnt through taunting her. You\nworked for the templars, he said. Thats practically the same thing.\nSlaves work for the templars, too, she spat\nback at him.\nJedra normally wouldnt have gotten mixed up in\nsomeone elses argument, but he wanted to talk with\nthis woman. Besides, he couldnt help noticing that,\ng i v e n  a  b a t h  a n d  a  c h a n c e  t o  b r u s h  o u t  h e r\nshoulder-length brown hair, she would be rather\npretty. It was enough to make him say, Does it\nmatter? Were all slaves now .\nThe dwarf growled, Yah, thanks to the likes of\nher. And maybe you, too, eh? You like templars, do\nyou?\nBut you got paid for it. Blood money, said the\ndwarf.\nStunned by the sudden accusation, Jedra stammered, Iof course not. I mean\nStay out of it, the womans voice said clearly in his\nmind. I can take care of myself. Aloud she said,\nLeave him alone. And leave me alone, too, or Ill\nheal your mouth closed for you.\n5</p>\n<p>A Little Knowledge\nHah, the dwarf snorted, but Jedra noticed\nthat he shut up.\nThe woman turned her attention back to Jedra.\nSo just how did trusting a magician get you\nhere?\nJedra told her the whole story about the piece of\nlightning glass, ending with Dornals betrayal.\nHe told you he was one of Those Who Wear the\nVeil? she asked.\nThats right.\nWell, that was his first lie. The Veiled Alliance\nreally are honest magicians, for the most part. But\ntheyre secretive as thieves when it comes to talking\nabout it, and they hate people like this Dornal.\nI wish Id known that before, Jedra said.\nShe laughed again. We all wish wed known\nsomething we didnt, or we wouldnt be here, thats\nfor sure. Whats your name, anyway?\nJedra. \nWhats \nyours?\nKayan.\nJedra looked up and down the slave hold, but the\nother slaves had already lost interest in the two of\nthem. He leaned close to her anyway. Softly, he\nasked, How did you do that, when you spoke to\nme in my mind?\nYou mean sending thoughts? Its a simple psionic\npower.\nIt wasnt quite like hearing her voice, but Jedra\nunderstood her words perfectly. His intention to ask\nabout his own ability vanished in a sudden, more\nimmediate question. How far can you reach with\nthat? he asked excitedly.\nDepends on how well I can visualize the person\nIm trying to contact, she said aloud. If its someone I know, I can talk to them almost anywhere.\nOtherwise, theyve got to be close.\nThen you can call for help!\nShe shook her head. Who would I ask? Most of\nthe people I know were the ones who put me here in\nthe first place. Theyd think it was real funny hearing from me now.\nBut there must be somebody\nLook, nobody I know is going to come after a\ncaravan just to rescue a couple of slaves. So unless\nyou know someone\nThe Jura-Dai would. The voice was high and\npure, and came from directly across the hold from\nJedra. He looked up to see an elf staring at him. His\nShe looked at him like he had drool on his chin.\nOne of the guards is a psionicist. Thats one of\nthe ways they keep slaves in line. Hell be watching\nfor escape attempts.\n O h . \nKayans expression softened. Look, Id try it in\na minute if I thought itd work, but I know my limits.\nI cant contact any random elf out there. Thats just\nnot the way it works.\nJedra nodded, feeling hope drain out of him, but\na sudden thought checked his plunge into despair.\nWait a minute. These psionic powers of yours\nare they something you can teach?\nWell, youve got to have some inherent ability,\nbut otherwise, yes, its possible. Why?\nJedra nodded toward Galar. You could teach\nhim. He knows plenty of elves.\nKayan looked at Jedra as if hed just suggested\nescaping by a trap doorand then shown her one at\nher own feet. But shed been a slave long enough to\nknow how debilitating false hope could be. Well,\nshe said cautiously, it might be worth a try.\nHuh? How would they know youd done anything?\nKayan shook her head. I dont know anyone in\nhis tribe. So unless theyre traveling along right beside us, I cant reach them.\nYou could try.\nAnd get myself blasted unconscious by the\nguards?\nWhat? Kayan asked.\nI am Galar of the Jura-Dai tribe. My people\nwould come for me if they knew I was here.\nTheyd attack a caravan just for you?\nGalar laughed. There is plenty of treasure on\nboard, too.\nJedra said to Kayan, You can send a message to\nhis tribe!\neyes were set close in a narrow face, and his nose was\nslender and long. Everything about him was long.\nEven bent at the knees, his legs stretched nearly\nacross to Jedra, and his reddish blond hair reached\nthe floor despite being braided. He was like an exaggerated version of Jedra himself, whose elven features had been rounded and shortened by his\nhuman heritage.\n6</p>\n<p>Jerry Oltion\nGalar, they soon discovered, had all the telepathic\nability of a rock. He couldnt even make himself\nheard psionically across the slave hold, much less\nacross the expanse of desert between him and his\ntribe. Jedra, however, surprised them all. With only\na few hours of Kayans coaching, he learned to send\nhis thoughts to anyone in the hold, even the thrikreen. His control was terribleeveryone near his\nintended target heard garbled voices in their heads,\nas wellbut the raw power behind his sending was\nmore than Kayan had ever seen before.\nYoud better stop, she suggested after a particularly strong blast had reached half the slaves in the\nhold. Theres no way the guards couldve missed\nthat. They might not care about a little telepathy\namong the slaves, but theyre going to do something\nabout it if you keep it up.\nJedra sighed. Hed been given a glimpse of something incredible within himself, then told to close his\neyes. I think I should try to contact the Jura-Dai,\nhe said. You admitted my powers stronger than\nyours; I might be able to reach them.\nNo! Kayan pounded the deck between them\nwith her fist. You dont know what youre talking\nabout. Your unfocused thoughts wouldnt make it\nbeyond the first dune. Youve got to learn control\nfirst. She leaned back against the wall. Wait.\nBide your time. Sooner or later an opportunity\nwill come along, and then maybe you can use your\ntalent .\nMaybe, Jedra grumbled, but he supposed\nKayan was right. He would waitfor a little while.\nHe soon learned that the easiest way to wait-and\nto escape the heatwas to spend as much time as\npossible unconscious. He leaned back against the\nwall and let the creaking of the wagon lull him to\nsleep.\nJedra floated face-down in a pool of water. The bottom was far out of reach, but the water was so clear\nonly a faint shimmering told him he was seeing\nthrough anything but air. He drifted peacefully\nalong, watching his shadow slip over the sand below, but when another shadow blotted out his own\nand he turned to see what cast it, he found himself\nsuddenly sinking downward.\nHe thrashed his arms and legs, but the water\nwouldnt support him. He hadnt been breathing\nThe foreign shadow extended itself toward him,\nand suddenly Jedra felt a hand clasping his arm,\npulling him upward. His head broke the surface,\nand he gasped in a breath, blinking in astonishment\nat his rescuer. It was Galar, still bound at the wrists,\nbut behind him Jedra could see an entire tribe of\nelves. He saw their gaily colored tents, their herds of\nlong, beetlelike pack animals called kanks, their willowy children playing in the sand\nJedra sat up with a start, momentarily disoriented\nto find himself back in the slave hold of the merchant caravan. Hed seen a tribe of elves! He could\nstill see them clearly in his mind.\nCould his sleeping brain have used some sort of\npsionic vision to locate the Jura-Dai? It was possible; Kayan had told him he had other untrained\nskills besides telepathy. Jedra turned to ask her, but\nshe was still asleep, and now that he was using his\neyes again, the image in his mind started to fade.\nHe closed his eyes and tried to concentrate. Yes,\nthere they were, a whole tribe of elves camped out\nnear a desert oasis. He could still see them, but he\nknew he couldnt hold onto them for long.\nIt was now or never, he realized. Concentrating\nhard on the elves in his vision, he tried to focus his\nthoughts in the way Kayan had taught him. He felt\na hint of recognition, a faint twinge of contact. It\nwas enough. He summoned all the energy he could\nmuster into the single thought:\nGalar of the Jura-Dai is held captive in a caravan\na day out from Urik on the road to Tyr.\nRetribution came suddenly and with such intensity that Jedra cried out as if he were being burned\nalive, for that was exactly what it felt like. He\nwrithed in agony, feeling his skin peel away in sheets\nof flame. The pain was worse than anything hed\nimagined possible, and it went on and on, far longer\nthan it would have if hed really been on fire. A real\nfire would have killed him by now.\nThen, as suddenly as it had come, the pain went\naway. Jedra collapsed on the deck, gasping for air.\nKayan lifted him to cradle his head on her lap.\nYou had to try it, she said.\nDream, \nJedra \nwhispered \nthrough \nthe \nmemory\nof pain. I saw the elves in a dream, saw my\nchance.\nwhile adrift; now he needed to breathe desperately\nbut couldnt.\n7</p>\n<p>A Little Knowledge\nGalar looked to Jedra and asked, Did you\nreach them?\nI dont know. Jedras whole body shuddered\ninvoluntarily with the release of tension. I couldnt\ntell.\nGalar asked Kayan, Could he really have found\nthem in a dream?\nShe shrugged. Who knows? Its possible, I suppose. What did you see?\nJedra described the camp, with its colored tents\nand pens full of kanks.\nYour chance to get us all punished, the dwarf\ngrowled, eyeing the door warily, but no guards appeared.\nColored \ntents? \nasked \nGalar.\nRed and green and yellow, with blue and yellow\nbanners flying from their peaks, Jedra said.\nGalar shook his head sorrowfully. I dont know\nwhom you saw, if indeed you saw anyone at all, but\nthe tents of the Jura-Dai are the color of the sand.\nTheir only marking is the tribe totem on the walls.\nGalar held out his arm to show them a tattoo on his\nwrist: an angular, stylized raincloud with daggers for\nraindrops.\nOh. Jedra pulled himself up to a sitting position. I was stupid. Im sorry.\nDont be, Kayan said. You didnt know. Id\nhave probably done the same thing in your position.\nI didnt know, Jedra said sullenly. Thats\nstarting to sound like my motto.\n D o n  t  b e  s o  h a r d  o n  y o u r s e l f ,   s h e  s a i d .\nYoure learning.\nOh yes. Ill be a master by the time I die on the\nziggurat. With that, Jedra turned away and\nrefused to respond to any further words of comfort.\nThe wagon rolled on. Exhausted, Jedra slept, this\ntime without any dreams of elves, and when he\nawoke it was already morning. The guards brought\nwooden mugs of water and bowls of thin gruel, but\nJedra had barely eaten half of his before they unshackled him and led him into the upper decks of\nthe wagon. He expected to be taken to the psionicist\nand reprimanded again for his offense, so he was\nsurprised when the guard brought him to the cabin\nhe had shared for so short a time with Dornal. The\nguard knocked, and the mage himself opened the\ndoor.\nWell, hello, Dornal said, stepping aside. Do\ncome in. The guard gave Jedra a shove, and he\nstaggered into the room.\nThank you, Dornal said, tossing the guard a\nsilver coin. Jedra gasped. That was probably more\nmoney than the man made in a month; Dornal was\nobviously buying his silence. Sure enough, the\nguard left and closed the door behind him.\nYou were holding out on me, Dornal said, almost conversationally. You shouldnt have done\nthat, because now I will have to use less subtle methods to extract the information I need. He waved his\nhands, and Jedra once more felt his muscles lock\ninto place.\nThe wagon lurched. He felt himself topple forward and instinctively tried to throw out his hands to\nkeep his balance. Spell-crippled, his arms didnt\nmove, but he nonetheless kept his balance, and\nDornal, directly in front of him, staggered backward as if Jedra had actually pushed him.\nWhats this? the man asked, astonished. He\nrighted himself and waved his arms again, just as\nJedra frantically tried to imagine a fist slamming into the magician. Dornal rocked back on his heels\nwith the blow, but the renewed binding spell\nclamped down on the boy with the force of a giants\n8</p>\n<p>Jerry Oltion\nfist; he fell face-first to the deck, striking with a resounding thump. Blood gushed from his nose, and\nit felt as if hed bitten his tongue.\nYour pitiful little tricks wont help you, boy,\nDornal growled, kicking Jedra repeatedly until the\nhalf-elf nearly fainted from the pain of broken ribs\nand a fractured skull. Jedra tried to scream, but the\nbinding spell wouldnt allow it. He tried to strike out\npsionically, but the pain prevented him from concentrating.\nSatisfied at last that Jedra was subdued, Dornal\ndragged him by the heels into the patch of sunlight\nshining through the porthole. Jedra felt the heat on\nhis bare back, then a sudden burning. Dornal was\nusing the lightning glass on him.\nNow, Dornal said, you will tell me everything you know.\nHe relaxed the binding spell enough to allow Jedra to speak, and the boy let out his breath in a\nlong, gurgling scream. At last he found his voice.\nStop! he shouted, turning his head far enough\nto see the magician kneeling over him. Ill tell you\nanything you want!\nYou will tell me the truth, Dornal said, drawing the point of heat slowly across Jedras back.\nStarting with what other powers you have and how\nyou invoke them.\nCursing and weeping with the pain, Jedra told\nDornal what little he knew, but the magician obviously didnt believe him. He held the glass over the\nboys back, demanding more, until Jedra wished he\nhad some hidden knowledge to give Dornal so that\nthe torture would end.\nAt last Jedra screamed, I dont know any more!\nKill me or let me go, but stop hurting me.\nDornal leaned back out of the sunlight and\nscraped sweat off his brow with the edge of his hand.\nYoure in no position to make demands, he said.\nOn the other hand, Im beginning to think youre\ntelling the truth. He gave Jedra one last burn just\nfor spite, then went to the door and shouted for the\nguard to put the boy back in the hold.\nThis time his wounds were real. Jedra was dimly\naware of being locked up again, of warm hands\ntouching him, of Kayan and Galar discussing his\ninjuries, but he was beyond caring. He wanted only\nto die.\nEven death was denied him. Jedra felt strength\npouring back into him with the same relentlessness\nwith which it had been ripped away, healing and revitalizing his wounds. It took time; he was aware of\nthe wagon moving again and of the day wearing on\ninto night. He was aware of Kayan holding onto\nhim throughout. She was doing this, he knew. She\nwas lending him her strength.\nHe woke with the dawn, aching and hungry but\nhealed. Kayan looked gaunt with fatigue. When the\nguards came with food and water he made her eat\nand drink most of his, despite her protests that he\nneeded it as much as she did.\nYou gave me too much of your own strength,\nhe said. Then, more softly, I didnt know such a\nthing was possible.\nOf course it is, she said. Thats how healing\nworks. All of my powers are like that. Sharing\nthoughts, sharing ability, sharing health-its all the\nsame sort of thing.\nSharing ability?\nShe shrugged. Well, if youve got something\nDepends on what youre trying to do. Why?\nWhat would happen if we both tried calling the\nJura-Dai?\nKayan snorted. Will you forget that idea?\nWasnt it enough that you almost got yourself\nkilled?\nyou can do but I cant, and if Ive got something I\ncan do but you cant, then we can put our heads\ntogether and do them both at the same time.\nJedra could feel sudden excitement building in\nhim. What if you try to share the same ability?\nDoes it get stronger?\nNot if we can make it work this time. Look,\nyouve got the control we need to actually reach\nsomeone. Ive got the power to get us there even if\nwe dont know just who were looking for. I was close\nlast time, I know I was. A little more control and Id\nhave made contact.\nYou think.\nI know.\nIf youre wrong, then we both suffer the guards\nreaction. I cant heal you again if Im hurt too.\nThe dwarf said, Whether hes right or wrong,\nyoud better be able to take care of the guards before you try anything. Another escape attempt and\ntheyll probably punish us all. And if they do, I\n9</p>\n<p>A Little Knowledge\npromise you, youll regret it.\nbreathing in the dark beside him.\n W e  v e  g o t  t o  t r y  s o m e t h i n g ,   J e d r a  s a i d .\nLets at least say we died trying.\nWeve got to escape this caravan before we get to\nAfter a long time, she answered, Lets see if we\nTyr.\ncan try and live to tell about it instead.\nI have no objection to escaping, the dwarf said.\nYou just make sure we do escape when you try it,\nthough.\nHes right, said Kayan. Its a long trip. We\ncan afford to wait for a better opportunity.\nI dont want to wait.\nWell youre going to have to, she said, because Im not going to help you get yourself hurt\nagain.\nJedra looked to Galar for help, but the elf only\nheld out his slender hands in a gesture that said as\nplain as words, What can we do?\nAbout midday the caravan came to an outpost. The\nslaves could hear shouts of joy from the wagon\nguards, but those shouts soon turned to dismay\nwhen the guards saw that the outpost had been raided recently. The wagon stopped only long enough\nfor the guards to sift through the ruins, then started\nup again. That night when they brought water, the\nmugs were only half full. When the slaves complained, one of the guards growled, Be glad you\nget any. The raiders poisoned the well. Were all on\nhalf rations until we get to the next outpost.\nThe slaves had been getting the bare minimum\nalready; half that was hardly enough to keep them\nalive. They made it through another day and a half\nbefore a sandstorm blew up out of the deep desert\nand forced them to a stop, and there they stayed for\ntwo more days, listening to the howl of sand-laden\nwind battering against the wagons closed hatches.\nThe second day they got no water at all.\nTheir mouths and tongues were too swollen to allow speech. Theyve given up on their cargo, Kayan\nsaid in Jedras mind when the evening water time\ncame and went without a show of guards. Now\ntheyre hoarding whats left for themselves.\nI think its time we tried calling for help, Jedra\nanswered.\nN o .\nWhy not? Weve got nothing to lose, do we?\nWere going to die in this hold in a day or two anyway, unless we do something.\nKayan said nothing. Jedra could hear her labored\nThe convergence felt a little like the sharing of\nthoughts, but this time their combined consciousness grew until they felt like a single incredibly powerful being. The slave hold took on a shimmery, not\nquite substantial quality, as if the linked Jedra and\nKayan existed on a higher plane that was only loosely tied to reality. It looked much like Jedras underwater dream when he had seen the elves.\nUnlike in his dream, they could move freely here,\ndirecting their attention wherever they chose. Cautiously, lest they alert the psionic guard to their presence, they drifted through the wagons walls and out\ninto the desert, searching for a tribe of elves.\nThe sandstorm was a whisper of motion, nothing\nmore. In the dream, Jedra and Kayan became a\nswift, sleek-winged bird darting over the desert. The\nminds of other travelers were great funnels down\nwhich they could slide, only to find themselves looking out of strange eyes at the interiors of wagons or\ntents. None belonged to the elves they sought. They\nsearched outward in ever-widening spirals, leaving\nthe storm behind and speeding over the dunes faster\nthan any real bird could fly, rising higher and higher\nto see more desert at once-until, finally, they found\nan enormous well leading down toward dozens of\ntents pitched at the base of a mountainous dune.\nThe tents would have been hard to spot if the\ndreamscape hadnt exaggerated them out of proportion, for they were the same grayish yellow color\nas the sand. Their walls were decorated with the stylized cloud raining daggers that Galar had shown\nthem.\nF o u n d  t h e m !  t h e y  t h o u g h t  t o g e t h e r .  T h e y\ndropped toward the largest tent, felt themselves being drawn into the mind of the elf inside, and looked\nout through his eyes to see a bard playing a harp to\na dozen or more elves reclining on woven rugs. The\nelves clothing made up for the lack of color on their\ntents; men and women alike wore loose, rainbowcolored blouses and pants. Desert life had darkened\ntheir leathery skin to a deep brown.\nJedras and Kayans host became aware of their\npresence, and quickly they sent, Galar of the Jura10</p>\n<p>Jerry Oltion\nDai is a slave in a caravan caught in a sandstorm\nfive days out from Urik to Tyr.\nThey had no time to listen for a response. The\ntent and its occupants swirled as if they were smoke\nblown by the wind, and suddenly Jedra and Kayan\nwere adrift over the desert again. The guard, they\nrealized. He heard our sending.\nA whirlwind danced across the dunes toward\nthem: the guards attack on their minds rendered\nvisible in the dreamscape. Kayan and Jedra became\na bird again, darting in and out around the whirlwind, seeking some sign of weakness where they\ncould press an attack of their own.\nInside, the part that was still Kayan said, directly\ninto his mind.\nThey flew over the top and down through the center of the funnel. The whirlwind writhed like a\nsnake, trying to throw them out, but they were\nfaster. When they reached the point of the funnel\nthey grew larger and spread their wings outward\nwith the force Jedra had discovered when Dornal\nhad attacked him. The whirlwind spun into fragments, leaving a dark shadow of itself in its place.\nJedra and Kayan slid into the shadow and found\nthemselves in a silent, unguarded cave. They had\nknocked the guard unconscious.\nKill him, Jedra said.\nNo, heal him so no one else knows anything happened, Kayan answered, including himself.\nThey wound their way through the dark caverns\nof the guards mind, sealing off whole sections of it\nas they passed. They let him keep just enough psionic ability to monitor the slaves but not enough to\nharm them, and they blocked his memory of the\nbattle completely. They left him snoring peacefully\nin his cabin, then dissolved their link.\nComing out of convergence felt like losing half\ntheir intelligence. Jedra wanted to join again immediately, but the new fatigue in his dehydrated body\nwarned him that he had already paid a high enough\nprice for their temporary enhancement. Doing it\nagain would have to wait for better days.\nThe sandstorm blew over in the night, and the wagon moved out again the next day, reaching another\noutpost by evening. This one was still standing, and\nfor the first time in three days the slaves received\nwater. Their strength slowly returned, and Jedra\nand Kayan began to hope they might survive long\nenough to learn whether or not their efforts had\ncome to anything.\nThe other slaves werent even aware at first of\nwhat Jedra and Kayan had done, but since they had\nalready gotten away with it, the two finally decided\nto tell their fellow prisoners. At first the others were\ncautiously optimistic, but when another day passed\nwithout action, their mood began to grow ugly.\nThe elves arent going to come, said one.\nWe dont even know if they exist, said another.\nShouldve known better than to trust a half-elf\nboy, a third muttered.\nA half-elf and a templar, the dwarf put in,\nfeeding us false hope so wed think they were with\nus.\nGalar spoke up. If my people heard the call,\nthey will come.\nHe got his answer that evening, when a sudden\ncommotion broke out on the upper decks. Shouts\nand the pounding of running feet echoed down the\ncompanionways, and the wagon lurched to a halt as\na loud crack of thunder split the air.\nThey heard it, Jedra said. Give them time;\nthey were a long way away. But inwardly he\nwondered. Would they come?\nLink up, Kayan hissed, and almost immediately she and Jedra were back in convergence. The\nwagon became insubstantial, and their consciousness slipped away and upward to watch the battle.\nThe desert was covered with elves and their\nbeetlelike kanks. Armed raiders swarmed like ants\nup the sides of the wagon, hacking at the guards\nwith swords and overpowering them by sheer numbers. A silver eagle with iridescent wings flew\nthrough the dreamscape, breathing fire upon the\ndefenders; the elves had a psionicist as well, it\nseemed. A tiny whirlwind rose toward it-the greatly\ndiminished wagon guard returning the attack-but\neven as they joined battle a third warrior entered the\ndream.\nIt came as a giant black bat, but the bat was different in texture from the eagle and the whirlwind. It\nhad a soft-edged fuzziness about it, as if it were\nsomehow less substantial than the others, and its\nface was recognizably human.\nDornal, Jedra realized. Does he have psionic\npower, too?\n11</p>\n<p>A Little Knowledge\nHes fighting with magic, Kayan said. Thats why\nhe doesnt look the same as the others.\nHis insubstantiality in the psionic vision evidently\ndidnt affect his ability to enter the fray. The bat\nswept over the eagle and the whirlwind, spitting\nlightning bolts ahead of it like spears. It attacked\nindiscriminately, blasting both with multiple strikes\nuntil the eagle fell smoking from the sky and the\nwhirlwind blew away into nothing.\nThen it turned its attention to Jedra and Kayan.\nThey had been hovering overhead as a bird\nagain, but as the bat rose toward them their combined intellect fashioned a barrier, a sheet of glass\nthat trapped the lightnings fury and held the bat at\nbay.\nLightning glass, Jedra thought. Exulting in his\nnewfound abilities, he bent the glass to match the\nshape of the piece he had discovered in the bazaar,\nand suddenly the bat beneath it glowed white hot,\nflared, and disappeared in a cloud of greasy smoke.\nThe dreamscape shook as if gripped by an earthquake, and Jedra and Kayan tumbled out of convergence to find the slave hold full of elven raiders,\ntwo of whom were slicing through their bonds.\nThe  leader of the elves, a heavily muscled warrior\nwho bled from half a dozen sword slashes, advanced\ninto the hold. He grinned when he saw Galar and\nsaid, You look like walking death.\nSo do you, Galar replied, and the two embraced like long-lost brothers.\nYou may all go free, the elf warrior said to the\nslaves, but take nothing with you. Everything in\nthis wagon now belongs to the Jura-Dai.\nGalar nodded to Jedra and Kayan. These are\nthe ones who called you here, he said.\nThe warrior bowed to the half-elf and the human.\nIn that case, you may take whatever you wish, and\nyou may travel with the Jura-Dai until you reach the\nsafety of your own kind.\nThank you, Jedra said. Theres one thing in\nparticular Id like to retrieve. He took Kayans\nhand and led her out of the slave hold, up narrow\ncompanionways choked with elves already hauling\nthe wagons cargo away, and onto the passenger\ndeck.\nSmoke seeped from beneath Dornals cabin door.\nThey opened it cautiously, holding their breath\nagainst the stench of burned meat, and looked inside to see the magicians body lying on the floor, his\ncharred flesh curling from exposed bones.\nHorrified at the spectacle but unable to look\naway, Jedra stepped into the room. The floor was\nbarely scorched around the body; it was as if the\nmagician had burned from the inside out.\nHow could we have done such a thing? he whispered in his mind.\nWild talent can be unpredictable, Kayan answered.\nJedra stared at the body until he was forced to\nbreathe, then finally said, I think we need to tame it,\nthen.\nThe lightning glass rested on the floor near one\ncrisped hand. Jedra picked it up and turned away,\nbut Dornals traveling bag sitting open on the bunk\nmade him pause. He upended it, and along with the\nclothing out fell two small leather sacks. One held\nmagical amulets, and the other was full of money.\nJedra took them both and left the room. These\nwill probably be useful where were going, he said as\nhe closed the door behind him.\nWhere is that? Kayan asked aloud.\nSomeplace where we can find a real member of\nthe Veiled Alliance, he said.

The award for combat\nwithin the arena therefore adds to the points given\nfor defeating a creature as a warrior. The arena experience bonus only applies to gladiators.\nRanger: Among the warrior class, rangers have\nthe most unique abilities. Casting clerical spells and\nemploying thieflike qualities provides experience\nawards. Awards or using followers do not, however,\napply to everyday applications; only use of followers\nin life-threatening situations gain the ranger experience. DMs should not reward cowardly or greedy\nuse of followers.\nPreserver: Preservers benefit from the normal wizard experience point bonuses. However, when trying\nto maintain spell-casting secrecy, success wins for\nthe preserver an additional bonus. Because use of\nmagic is often illegalor at least discouraged\npreservers who try to conceal their magic use deserve\nthe listed XP bonus.\nDefiler: A defiler also receives the bonuses listed\nfor all wizards. When carrying out the business of\n64</p>\n<p>the sorcerer-king, defilers receive an additional experience point award for spells cast. The sorcererkings send their defilers out into the countryside to\nmaintain order and terror; sorcerer-kings who notice a successful underling send him additional support.\nCleric: The clerics granted powers can be very\npowerful, and so provide their own reward. With\nthem, a cleric and his party should be able to defeat\ngreater foes and, therefore, get greater group experience awards. There is consequently no special experience award for clerics; the priest awards suffice.\nHowever, should a cleric use his granted powers in\nan original way, employing his particular element\nwith finesse and flair to overcome an obstacle, the\nDM may wish to grant these bonus experience\npoints.\nDruid: The priest awards are generally adequate\nto give druid characters the experience they deserve.\nHowever, defeat of their arch-enemies, defilers, warrants a class experience award in addition to group\nexperience.\nTemplar: The conniving ways of the templar demand that he abuse his position for his own ends.\nThe class awards listed separately for the templar\nreward the use of that deceit.\nDMs should make certain that PC templars\nmake enemies every time an accusation or judgement is made. Victimizing a freeman brings few or\nlow-powered enemies. Nobles command greater respect and friendship, so a templar who accuses or\njudges a member of the aristocracy may well expect\nfoes in high places. Assassination is a common end\nfor templars.\nSimilarly, pardoning individuals can also gain a\ntemplar valuable friends.\nNote that accusations, judgements, and pardons\nonly give a templar experience when these acts further the templars ends. Pardoning an important\nnoble for a bribe or favor or accusing a stone merchant to temporarily get him out of the way will earn\nthe templar experience. Simply accusing, judging,\nfocus.

Examples of dwarf foci range from the broad (e.g., construction of a temple, protection of a village, quest\nfor a lost family member) to the narrow (e.g., journey from one city-state to another, escort a caravan,\nexplore a half-buried ruin). The pursuit of a relevant mission is perfectly acceptable, but relevance\nmust be agreed upon in advance by both the player\nand the DM. Dwarves rarely shift focus drastically\nbefore a project is completed, and only in the face of\nexceptional circumstances (e.g., imminent war, assassination of a brother, dragon attack on the area).\nAgain, these exceptional circumstances must be\nagreed upon in advance by both the player and\nDM.\nElf: An elfs roleplaying revolves around his selfreliance and relationships with outsiders. Outsiders\ninclude anyone not of the elfs tribe-even other\nelves. Thus, an elf on Athas should not wish to gain\nfriendship and trust with every character he meets;\non the contrary, he tests the trustworthiness of outsiders who display some redeeming characteristics\n(redeeming to an elf, that is). Elves also perform\nsuch tests on outsiders who try to befriend them. Elven PCs should put outsiders to tests of trust or loyalty whenever possible rather than trust them from\nthe onset just because theyre other player characters. The trust of an elf is not easily earned.\nSubtle tests of trust include the following:\n entrusting an outsider with a confidential piece of\ninformation,\n leaving a valuable item out in the open, in clear\nview, to see if the outsider takes it,\n arranging a secret rendezvous, then making sure\nthe outsider shows up in the right place and on\ntime,\n asking the outsider to deliver a message or item.\nLife-threatening tests of trust include the following\ni n g :\n letting oneself get captured by gith to see if the\noutsider attempts a rescue (this is a favorite\namong elves of the stony barrens),\n faking unconsciousness after a battle to see what\ncare the outsider provides,\n making certain part of the water supply is lost on\na cross-desert journey, then seeing if he gets a fair\nshare of whats left,\n challenging a particularly deadly enemy to see if\nthe outsider stands with him or flees.\nAn elf will also recognize displays of trust and loyalty that are not planned in advance. If an outsider\nfails one or more tests of trust, an elf player character should not consider him a friend and should never retest him. However, if a series of tests are passed,\nthe elf player character can declare the outsider a\nfriendno further tests will be necessary unless the\nfriend severely breaks that trust.\nWith regards to se f-reliance, elves never take animal transport unless they have been too injured to\nrun. Elf player characters should use running as\ntheir chief means of transport.\nHalf-elf: Seeking acceptance among humans and\nelves is important to every half-elf, though they will\nvehemently deny it. Simply observing a local custom\nof a human or elven community he is visiting gives a\nhalf-elf PC an experience point award. These customs are usually very simple, such as drinking the\nlocal ale with the elven chieftain or participating in a\nhuman wedding ritual. Such opportunities come up\nrather frequently when a half-elf character comes\nupon a new human or elven community. Experience\npoint awards, therefore, should be received the first\ntime the half-elf performs a particular custom.\nIn extreme cases, a local custom may take the\nform of a contest or competition. If the half-elf character can get involved and perform better than any\none of the humans or elves also participating, he receives the experience point award listed. If he does\nbetter than all of the humans or elves involved, he\ngains double that award. Examples of such contests\n6 6</p>\n<p>are archery contests, psionic strength games, artistic\ncompetitions, and animal training.\nWinning such half-elf awards will entail a great\ndeal of roleplaying; if the player makes the effort, he\nshould be rewarded.\nHalf-Giant: Adopting the lifestyles of others gives\na half-giant purpose. As a player character, a halfgiant should seek out the most charismatic member\nof the party and imitate his racial and class customs.\nWhen he does so, he will gain an experience point\nbonus.\nSometimes a particularly charismatic nonplayer\ncharacter may attract the attention of a player character half-giant. The half-giant character might, for a\ntime, even switch sides in an adventure, during which\ntime he should get his experience point bonus.\nWhen a half-giant character shifts his alignment\naccording to the influences he is experiencing in the\ncampaign, the DM should give him the experience\npoint bonus listed. This can be earned every time\nthe half-giant properly shifts alignment and roleplays that shift act accordingly, but no more than once\nper day.\nHalfling: Their curiosity and open-mindedness\ndemand that halflings a in  experiment with the customs\nof other races. When given the opportunity to do so,\nno matter how trivial the custom, the halfling gains\nan experience award bonus. This bonus includes\neverything from drinking from a caravan masters\nceremonial cup for luck to hunting wild erdlus with\nthe elf warriors. The DM should grant the award\nonly once per custom observed, regardless of repetition.\nHalflings are honor bound to aid one another\nwhen in need. This award should only be handed\nout when there is a danger of injury or loss of life to\nthe aiding halfling.\nMul: A muls ability to exert himself over long\nperiods of time can earn him an experience point\naward. Each 12 hours beyond the first 12 that a\nmul exerts himself (such as carrying a wounded party member, keeping watch, etc.) merits the listed\naward. Note that the exertion must be necessary to\nthe adventure, a judgement subject to the DMs approval.\nThri-kreen: A thri-kreens natural combat abilities are formidable and shouldnt be overlooked in\nfavor of human tactics. A player whose thri-kreen\nuses natural combat abilities will gain the awards\nlisted. Again, instances must be relevant to the adventure to warrant an award.\nEach creature slain and taken back to a camp or\nnest for food also warrants an experience point\naward; the Hit Dice or relative toughness of the\ncreature has no effect on the award.\n67</p>"}, "title": {"show": false}, "image": {"displayMode": 0}, "sort": 3000}], "sort": 3000}

Surprise rolls and encounter distances appear in the Players Handbook, and the philosophy\nand details of encounters appear in the Dungeon\nMasters Guide. The additional rules given here\nspecifically target Dark Sun encounters, making\nthem easier and faster to run for the DM.\nWizard, Priest, and Psionicist\nEncounters\nSpellcasters and psionicists pose numerable problems for the DM, not the least of which is deciding\nwhat spells or psionic powers they can use at the\ntime of the encounter. In instances when the DM\nhas particular spells he needs NPCs to have, he\nshould choose those spells and fill out the rest, using\nthe system given there.\nAt times, an encounter with a large group of creatures calls for multiple spell casters or psionicists.\nThe DM may wish to roll their spells or powers as a\ngroup to save time. Encounters where 15 elven\npsionicists can all perform different psionic actions\nmay be interesting, but are nightmarish for the\nDM. Rolling for spells or powers as a group simplifies the action and can satisfy for DMs and players\nalike.\nEncounters in City-States\nAthasian city states are usually very crowded and\nbusy: half-elven merchants loudly hawk their wares\nin bazaars and street corners; slaves and peasants\nbear nobles high on sedan chairs and force their way\nroughly through the throngs; templar guards patrol\nthe streets against the many thieves and low-lifes\nthat scurry through the alleys and sewers. Even at\nnight, the decadent lifestyles of the wealthy keep the\ncity alive with festivals and parties that last until the\ndawn.\nWhen dealing with encounters in a city, it is more\nappropriate to ask whom the player characters do\n77\nnot encounter than whom they do. Any normal\ndenizen of the cities-peasants, slaves, templar\nguards, merchants, nobles-can be located without\nmuch trouble: they are ubiquitous. If the player\ncharacters wish to avoid some particular encounter,\nsuch as with the city guards or with a particular aristocrat, that too is fairly easy; city states throng with\ncrowds.\nSpecific encounters should be set up by the DM.\nThese will mostly be adventure-specific, presenting\nthe player characters with individuals that will help\nor hinder their progress.\nMonsters\nMany of the monsters presented in the AD&D\nM o n s t r o u s  C o m p e n d i u m s  a r e  a p p r o p r i a t e  f o r\nDARK SUN campaigns.

When they cast spells,\nthey ruin the ground around them, according to\nspell-level, just as described in Chapter 7: Magic.\nAs a result, spell-wielding monsters rarely cast spells\ndirectly from their lair. Those who merely have spelllike abilities do not cause defiling damage when using those abilities.\nPsionics: Of all the monsters in the following list,\nonly yuan-ti have psionic powers (according to the\nComplete Psionics Handbook). However, all those\nmarked with an asterisk could possess wild powers in\nDARK SUN campaigns.

For purposes of cross country\nPlant Growth\nmovement, an affected character can travel double\nhis normal movement rate (and may still force\nmarch beyond that, though he is still subject to\nthose effects). The characters movement rate is\ndoubled in combat situations, as well, but his balPsionic Dampener (Alteration)\nance and inertia make it difficult to maneuver. If he\nmoves greater than his normal movement rate and\nattempts to turn in any way, such as to round a corner or to avoid an obstacle, he must make a successful Dexterity check to avoid falling (ending his\nmovement for the round and making him prone).\nThe reverse of this spell, stone feet, makes the affected characters legs feel as heavy as rock, slowing\nhis movement to half. The characters balance is\nunaffected.

The material components must be any handful of available\npebbles.\nThis spell has no effect on a tree of life.

The spell may be cast by a\ndefiler or a preserver, though a defiler will cause\nmore damage with it.\nThe casting of the spell causes a large area of vegetation to instantly give up its magical potential and\nturn to ash. Unlike the natural destruction of defiling magic, raze affects all vegetation within the radius of the spell, regardless of the terrain. The area of\neffect for a preserver is one yard per level of the caster. For a defiler, it is five yards plus one yard per level\nof the caster (in lieu of normal defiling damage).\nThe ash created is black and grey, completely devoid of life or life-giving elements. Nothing will grow\nthere for half a year, leaving a lifeless circular scar\non the ground.\nThe material component for the spell is sand\nground between two pebbles (or sand from an hour\nglass for the reverse).\nthe stone will occupy the space where the sand was\nat the time of casting. Persons standing with their\nfeet in the sand at the time of casting will have to\nbreak themselves free, though a saving throw vs.\nparalyzation is allowed to jump free, (if possible).\nThe fact that an area of sand has been so turned to\nsandstone is not readily apparent even after the spell\nhas been cast. Viewers may have to make an Intelligence check to notice that there is stone where there\nwas once sand. Though permanent, the magically\ncreated sandstone will quickly break down into sand\nparticles over a period of 2d6 days. The reverse of\nthis spell, transmute stone to sand, allows the caster\nto change any type of stone to sand (sandstone,\ngranite, gems, clay brick, concrete, etc.). Stone\nitems such as weapons become useless. Floors turned to sand may cause those standing on them to lose\ntheir balance and fall (dexterity check to avoid).\nSupporting stones in buildings so affected can easily\ncause a structure to completely collapse.\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: Permanent\nCasting Time: 5 rounds\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nT r a n s m u t e  S a n d  t o  S t o n e  ( A l t e r a t i o n )\nReversible\nFifth-Level Spells\nTransmute Rock to Mud\nRejuvenate (Alteration)</p>\n<p>to an area of ground.

The radius of the circle is 5 feet per level of the\nDoom Legion (Necromancy)\ncaster. Once cast, the soil is enriched and moistened, and a layer of fine grass emerges instantly.\nThe duration of the spell varies. Once cast, the\nmoist soil and grass are not magical, and are subject\nto all natural forces upon them. They will, however,\nsurvive a week in even the worst of conditions.

They have powerful, lanky legs ending in four-toed\nfeet with razor-sharp claws, and can run at great speeds over short\ndistances (no more than half-a-mile).

Humans and demihumans can\nlive on this nectar alone for periods of up to three weeks, but must\nsupplement their diets with meat and/or vegetation after longer\nperiods.

They are a race of ignorent demihumans who dwell in the most forlorn wastes of Athas.\nThey have a taste for the flesh of intelligent races and no ruler will\ntolerate them within five days travel of his city.\nCombat: Belgoi usually attack by sneaking up on their victims\ncamp and selecting a juicy looking target. Each belgoi rings a smell\nbell that allows it to make contact with its victim, then attempts to\nuse domination to take over the victims body end have him leave\ncamp, or attraction to lure the victim into the darkness. If the belgois contact is successful, only the victim can hear the bell, but if it\nfails, then the entire party hears it.\nOnce the victim is lured out of camp, the belgoi caresses and\ntouches the victim, temporarily draining 1d6 points of Constitution\nper round (duration: 1d4 turns, victim loses all bonuses due to high\nConstitution). Upon reaching 0 Constitution points, the victim\nfells unconscious, and the belgoi sits down to feast.\nIf forced into melee combat, the belgoi strike with their wicked\nclaws, inflicting en 1d4+2 points of damage.

Therefore, battles with belgoi often\nturn into long, running fights that last for many days. The only wey\nto prevent the belgoi from returning time after time is to kill them all\nbefore they have a chance to escape.\nHabitat/Society: Basically, the belgoi form huge raiding tribes end\nbehave as such.

They\nhave exaggerated and sometimes comical features, such as huge\nnoses, ears, mouths, and so forth. Their skin is usually dark red to\nblack in color, and their hair is coarse and sturdy (giant hair ropes\nare the best on Athas). Most humanoid giants have a Strength\nscores of 25.\nBeast-headed giants resemble humanoid giants in many respects,\nsave that they are slightly smaller (15-20 feet). In place of the head of a\nman or woman, they have the head of some beast, and their skin is\nusually an extremely pale color, like pink or alabaster. Beast-headed\ngiants are rarely seen in the Tablelands, for they are just short enough\nto make wading through the Sea of Silt hazardous to their safety.\nEcology: Most giants feed themselves through herding sheep,\nkanks, erdlus, and other animals. They often supplement this simple lifestyle through raiding, simple forms of commerce (such as by\nselling their hair to rope-makers), and occasionally by hiring themselves out as mercenaries (though this is considered quite dishonorable by most giants).\nBeast-headed giants tend to be more hostile, and treat all nongiants as vermin. They are magical mutations of normal giants, and\nare treated by their brethren as inferior beings. Since beast-headed\ngiants are on the whole somewhat wiser and more intelligent than\nhumanoid giants, this makes them understandably bitter.\nHabitat/Society: Generally, humanoid giants are only destructive\nwhen they want something, or when a stranger has landed on their\nisland uninvited. Otherwise, they are quite congenial and friendly.\nOffensively, giants like to get to the heart of the matter, melee, as\nquickly as possible. They will charge into the fray swinging their\nhuge clubs. When hit by a giant, any being of man-size of smaller\nmust save vs. paralysis or be knocked off his feet and fly 1 yard per\npoint of damage inflicted.\nCombat: Giants fight in two basic modes: defensively or offensively.\nWhen fighting defensively, such as when protecting their island\nhomes from uninvited guests, their favorite tactic is to hurl boulders\nat the enemy from as great a range as possible (up to 250 yards),\ndoing 2d10 damage to anyone or anything they hit.\n92</p>\n<p>Gith\nNote: Only leaders commanding 25 or more gith have psionic\npowers.

They are extremely intelligent and cunning, but regard humans or demihumans as foolish, dangerous creatures and\nwill rarely tolerate them.\nDuring the actual fight, the lozhal attempts to defend itself first\nwith psionics and magic, then with any magical items it currently\npossesses (roll on Table 88 in DMG, results calling for armor,\nshields, or weapons count as no magical item in iozhals possession). If that fails, it will bite with its teeth for 1d8 points of damage,\nor strike with any weapon available to it (with a -2 damage modifier.)\n9 4</p>\n<p>Silk Wyrm\nCLI M A T E /T E R RA I N:  Badl an ds\nFREQUENCY:\nUncommon\nORGANIZATION:\nSolitary\nACTIVITY CYCLE:\nAny\nDIET:\nCarnivore\nINTELLIGENCE:\nLow (5-7)\nTRE A S U R E :\n(W)\nALIGNMENT:\nNeutral\nN O .

Varying between three and six feet in\nlength, they usually stand about as high as a mans thigh. All four\nof their lithe feet end in long sharp claws, and huge canine fangs\nprotrude from beneath the flappy lips of their squarish snouts. The\ntembo has huge, squarish ears which it can turn in any direction,\nindependently of each other.\nCombat: Though all tembo love to fight, their battle tactics are as\nunpredictable as these vicious beasts themselves. Some attack by\nstealth from a short distance away, sneaking as close as possible to\ntheir victims and trying to destroy them with a death field. Others\nprefer to play with their victims, batting them from one paw to another, using life draining each time the paw lands. Still other tembos like to leap into the fray immediately, meleeing their victims\nfrom the first round.\nIn such physical confrontations, the tembo are true horrors.\nTheir favorite tactic is to leap at their victim, attacking with all four\nfeet and their bite at once. The front claws cause only 1d4 damage,\nbut the back claws have a greater tendency to sink into softer flesh,\nripping through important tendons and organs (which is why they\ndo more damage). The greatest danger of the tembo comes from its\nhorrid mouth, however. When the tembo successfully hits with its\npowerful jaws, the victim must make a saving throw vs. death magic\nor lose one life level. This loss is permanent, and a save must be\nmade each time the tembo lands a successful bite.\nWhen attacked from a distance, the dexterous tembo have a 40%\nchance of dodging any non-magical missile fire directed at them.\nTembo display no fear, and will always fight to the death rather\nthan run.\nHabitat/Society: Tembo prowl the desert in small packs that seem\nto have no real social organization or cohesiveness. Each tembo\ndoes more or less as it pleases, not sharing any prey it downs with\nthe others. The tembos one concession to social life is that if one of\nthem is attacked, the entire pack will join to fight the enemy.\nEcology: The favorite food of the tembo is the young of any other\nrace. Tembo are famous for sneaking into a nomadic camps to drag\noff elven children, for skulking about dwarven villages prowling for\nuntended toddlers, even for sneaking into populated cities to snatch\nnoble babes from their cradles. Needless to say, this makes these\ndespicable beasts universal objects of hatred. Even feuding elf\ntribes, the most dedicated of enemies, have been known to call a\ntruce for the purposing of hunting down a tembo pack that has\nappeared in the area.\n9 6</p>"}, "title": {"show": false}, "image": {"displayMode": 0}, "sort": 6000}], "sort": 6000}

As a result, Dark Sun characters can more\neasily accomplish proficiency checks, which are\nbased upon attributes. Even so, players should remember that rolling a natural 20 still results in failure, regardless of their characters attribute scores.\nDark Sun Weapon Proficiencies\nWeapon proficiencies and specialization function\nas usual for all Dark Sun character classes extent\nthe gladiator class. Gladiators begin the game with\nproficiency in every weapon. In addition, they can\nspecialize in any number of weapons, provided they\nhave enough slots available to do so. A gladiator\nmust spend two slots to specialize in any melee or\nmissile weapon except a bow, which requires three\nslots. Gladiators thus transcend the rule that limits\nspecialization to fighters.\nFor example, Barlyuth, a dwarven gladiator, starts\nthe game with four weapon proficiency slots. As a\ngladiator, he already holds proficiency in all weapons, so he neednt spend any of his four slots to become proficient. Instead, he may spend all four slots\nto specialize in two melee weapons, or spend three\nslots to specialize in a bow weapon and save the remaining slot for later specialization.\nA 9th-level gladiator could thus specialize in two\nmelee weapons and one bow weapon (seven total\nweapon proficiency slots) and an 18th-level gladiator could specialize in five melee weapons (10 total\nweapon proficiency slots). A gladiator gains all the\nbenefits for every weapon in which he specializes,\nsuffering no penalty for multiple specializations.\nNew Nonweapon Proficiencies\nGENERAL\nProficiency\nSlots\nAbility\nModifier\nBargain\n1\nW i s\n- 2\nHeat Protection\n1\nI n t\n- 2\nPsionic Detection\n1\nW i s\n- 2\nSign Language\n1\nD e x\nWater Find\n1\nI n t\n0\n0\nPRIEST\nBureaucracy\nSomatic\nConcealment\n1\nChr \n-2\n1 \nDex\n- 1\nWARRIOR\nArmor\nOptimization\n1\nDex\n2\nWeapon \nImprovisation \n1\nWis \n-1\nWIZARD\n1 \nDex\n- 1\nSomatic\nConcealment\nDescription of New Proficiencies\nAs in the Players Handbook, the proficiencies\nhere appear alphabetically with description and\nrules for using them in a campaign.\nArmor Optimization: This proficiency allows a\ncharacter to use his armor to best advantage against\na particular opponent (much like the gladiator special ability). A successful proficiency check in the\nfirst round of any combat situation gives a -1 bonus to the characters Armor Class in that situation. A situation is a series of rounds in which a\nparticular character engages in combat. Once the\ncharacter goes two full rounds without combat, the\nsituation ends. The character must be wearing some\ntype of armor or employing a shield in order to use\nthe armor optimization proficiency. The bonus provided by the armor or shield adds to the bonus from\nthe armor optimization proficiency. Furthermore,\nthe bonus from the armor optimization proficiency\nadds to that of the gladiator special ability.\n4 4</p>\n<p>tection proficiency has learned to use clothing and\npersonal pacing to optimize endurance against the\nrigors of Athas heat. With a successful check, the\ncharacter need only consume half the normal\namount of water per day to avoid dehydration. In\ncombat, the heat protection proficiency allows a\ncharacter wearing metal armor to battle better and\nlonger. A successful check each round allows the\nHeat Protection: A character with the heat proreaucratic systems.\ncharacters in a number of situations. A successful\ncheck shortens the time a character spends in a city\ndungeon awaiting judgement. It can also speed the\nprocess of gaining an audience with an important\ntemplar or other official. The bureaucracy proficiency helps a character understand political hierarchies and who to consult to get a job done. A\nsuccessful check also allows the character to pay\n10% less on a tax levied against him; two successful\nchecks in a row allow him to avoid the tax altogether.\nIn addition to these example uses, the bureaucracy proficiency functions in countless other ways to\nlet a character understand and use (or abuse) buciency.\nSimple and protracted barter are fully explained\nin Chapter 6: Money and Equipment.\nBureaucracy: The bureaucracy proficiency helps\nBargain: A character with the bargain proficiency\ncan haggle over cash, service, and barter transactions\nto capture a better deal. In a cash transaction, a successful check allows the character to purchase an item\nfor 10% less or sell one for 10% more than the going\nrate. In a simple barter transaction, a successful check\nimproves the perceived value of the bargainers goods\nby 10%. In protracted barter, a successful check allows the bargainer to roll 3d6 instead of 2d6 for that\nround of barter; a separate check initiates every\nround. (See Chapter 6: Money and Equipment). In a\nservice transaction, a successful check provides the\nbargainer 10% more than the going rate for his services. The DM should require players to roleplay the\nbargaining session to gain the benefits of this proficharacter to avoid the THAC0 loss for that round.\nIn addition, when the character reaches his Constitution score limit to rounds of combat, a successful\ncheck will allow him to fight for five more rounds.\nThis check can be made at the end of every subsequent five round period, but once failed, the character collapses from exhaustion.\nDehydration receives full explanation in Chapter\n14: \nTime \nand \nMovement. \nThe \neffects \nof \nusing\nmetal armor in combat appear in Chapter 6:\nMoney and Equipment.\nPsionic Detection: The psionic detection proficiency works much as the metapsionic devotion psionic sense, but is much less powerful. With this\nproficiency, a Dark Sun character uses his latent\npsionic ability to detect the expenditure of psionic\nstrength points (PSPs) around him.\nWhen employing this proficiency, a character\nmust clear his mind and concentrate, taking at least\none full round to prepare. A successful check allows\nthe character to detect the expenditure of any PSPs\n4 5</p>\n<p>within 50 yards of his location, regardless of intervening material objects. A character can maintain\nuse of the proficiency for successive rounds, but during that time he cannot move or perform any other\naction. The proficiency check, however, must succeed on the round the PSPs are expended or the\ncharacter detects nothing.\nPsionic detection proficiency can only inform a\ncharacter that PSPs were expended within 50 yards,\ntelling nothing more. The detecter cannot determine the number of PSPs, their source, the powers\nor devotions drawn upon, or the purpose of the expenditure (e.g., to initialize a power or to maintain\none). This proficiency is not cumulative with other\ndetection techniques.\nA player whose character has psionic detection\nproficiency should ensure that the DM knows. Often the DM will secretly roll the proficiency and inform the player of results.\nSign Language: Those who have mastered the\nuse of sign language can communicate among\nthemselves without words, provided they can see\neach others hands. Signing is a language unto itself: it conveys ideas that any other character with\nthe sign language proficiency can understand, regardless of their native language.\nTo use sign language for an entire round, all parties\ninvolved must make a successful check. Characters\nwho succeed can converse together for an entire minute; those who fail cannot listen. When a PC signs\nsuccessfully with an NPC, the DM should speak freely with the player for one minute per round. Every\nround of conversation requires another check. A\nfailed check means that either the speaker didnt perform his finger movements accurately, the listener\nwasnt watching the speaker closely enough, or something else blocked communication.\nOn Athas, many groups employ sign language for\ncovert conversations. In some city states, using sign\nlanguage can be grounds for imprisonment. Though\nsign language throughout Athas is generally consistent, secret societies often employ special codes so that\nunwanted eyes cannot decipher specific conversations.\nSomatic Concealment: Though spell casters can\nmumble verbal components and hide material components in their hands or robes, somatic components are harder to hide. The somatic component of\nany spell, magical or clerical, is apparent to any\ncharacter watching the spell caster. On Athas,\nwhere spell casting is sometimes illegal, the ability to\nhide the necessary gestures becomes important. If\nmovements can be concealed, a spell can be unleashed without calling attention to the caster.\nA character using the somatic concealment proficiency must announce to the DM his intention to do\nso at the beginning of the round. Then, when the\ncharacter casts his spell, the DM makes his roll in\nsecret. A successful check indicates that anyone\nwho could normally view the wizard doesnt recognize his gestures as magical in nature. A failed\ncheck means that all who can view the casting wizard see his movements for what they really are.\nWater Find: Even the most barren desert yields\nwater to those who know how to find it. Small animals burrow in the ground and store water there;\nsome rare plants store water in cistern roots beneath\nthe soil; seemingly lifeless trees sometimes have\nmoist heartwood. The find water proficiency can only be used once per day and takes an hour to perform. During this time the character can only move\nhalf as far as normal. A successful check indicates\nhe has found sufficient water to sustain himself for\none day. It does not mean that he has found enough\nwater to rehydrate, but he will not further dehydrate\nthat day. The character can only find enough water\nfor himselfif he shares his find with others, none\nof them gains any benefit.\nWeapon Improvisation: In Dark Sun, virtually\nanything can be (and has been) used as a weapon.\nA character with this proficiency rolls against Wisdom to spot a useable weapon just about anywhere.\nA successful check means the character has found a\nclub that does 1d6+1 damage to man-sized and\nsmaller creatures, or 1d3+1 to larger opponents.\n4 6</p>\n<p>The DM may assign modifiers for the ease or difficulty of finding such a weapon: a marketplace might\nwarrant a +2, a barren grassland a -2, and a\nsandy desert might annul the proficiency altogether.\nNonweapon Proficiency Group Crossovers\nCharacter Class\nProficiency Groups\nDefiler\nWizard, General\nGladiator\nWarrior, General\nPreserver\nWizard, General\nPsionicist\nPsionicist, General\nTemplar\nPriest, Rogue, General\nTrader\nRogue, Warrior, General\nUse of Existing Proficiencies in Dark Sun\nBecause Athas differs drastically from other\nAD&D® game worlds, some of the existing proficiencies may seem awkward in their application. For\ninstance, navigation and seamanship proficiencies\non a world without oceans of water are ludicrous\nand should only be considered for characters who\nare mad or unnaturally old (i.e., can remember the\nold Athas). The following text clarifies use of other\nsuch proficiencies in this desert world.\nAgriculture: On Athas, the low humidity makes\ngrain storage extremely easy, but raising crops far\nmore difficult. This proficiency covers the best use\nof land and water for a given crop and how to keep\nthat crop alive through the dry growing season.\nArmorer: The lack of metal on Athas leaves armorers to concentrate on other materials, namely\nchitin, bone, and stiffened leathers. Metal armor is\nso rarely constructed that, when such a task is undertaken, it is usually done so by a team of armorers\nand blacksmiths.\nArtistic Ability: This proficiency itself remains unchanged, but its usefulness upon Athas may be more\nfar-reaching. Slaves with artistic ability are sometimes\nbrought out of the mud pits and into the homes of\nnobles, where they are taught to read. Once out of\nfavor, however, literate slaves cannot be returned to the\n4 7\npitsthey are either executed or sent to the arena.\nBlacksmithing: As with the armorer proficiency,</p>\n<p>4 8\nblacksmiths perform the same functions, but have\nshifted their main material from metal to other durable substances.\nFishing: Obviously, fishing is only useful in the\nfew exotic places where pools of water support fish.\nNavigation: The methods of direction finding\ncommon to naval voyages prove equally useful for\ncaravans crossing the trackless seas of sand.\nReligion: Large, organized religions have never\ndeveloped on Athas, though sorcerer-kings make\nthemselves out to be gods or godlike and have surrounded themselves in religious mystique. On a local level, cities and villages have ancient lore about\nmysterious beings or demigods, but consistent mythic systems are never widespread.\nSeamanship: This proficiency only finds study by\nmadmen, fools, or the preternaturally ancient.\nSwimming: This proficiency applies rarely; for example, in the decadent pools of nobles or small\nbodies of natural water in exotic locales.\nWeaponsmithing: Again, this proficiency remains unchanged but for the materials used.\nUse of Survival Proficiency in Dark Sun\nAs described in the Players Handbook, each slot\nof survival proficiency must be applied to a specific\ntype of terrain. Athas contains sandy wastes, stony\nbarrens, rocky badlands, salt flats, mountains, jungles, and steppes. Survival proficiency gives the\ncharacter a chance to locate food and water in that\nparticular terrain, but only in minuscule amounts.\nA successful check allows a character to find\nenough water to avoid losing any Constitution\npoints from dehydration. The character will not rehydrate, and he may continue to dehydrate on subsequent days that he doesnt receive water. The\nsame check allows a character to find enough food\nto sustain him for a day.\nSurvival proficiency helps a character avoid poisons. A successful check informs the character whether a plant or animal is poisonous, provided the food\nsource is native to the proficiencys terrain type.</p>"}, "title": {"show": false}, "image": {"displayMode": 0}, "sort": 7000}], "sort": 7000}

Their imitative nature and\nbasically poor grasp of right and wrong facilitate\nthis flip-flopping of attitudes which, in game terms,\nmanifests itself as a change in alignment. One half\nof a half-giants alignment remains fixed, the other\nhalf may vary.\nA half-giant must choose an alignment every\nmorning, one that reflects a reaction to his changing\nenvironment, but it must be an alignment that the\nDM agrees to. In general, a half-giant will be imitative or will be reacting to his environment when a\nchange in alignment occurs. Unless there is a valid\nreason for the half-giant to become, say, chaotic evil\nfor a day, then the DM should not allow it. If a player repeatedly requests daily alignment changes simply for personal gain, the DM should suggest he\nplay another type of character. Remember, a halfLawful Good\ngiant characters alignment may change each day,\nbut it isnt mandatoryhe may go months at a time\nwithout a single change. For this reason, half-giant\ncharacters, while the dumbest in the campaign\nworld, are generally the most difficult to accurately\nroleplay.\nA half-giants shifting alignment should become\na hindrance as often as it is a boon.

Individually, characters should\nreact based on their alignment. As a group, they\nwill have to examine which of their number are\nstrong and capable and which are weak and in need\nof assistance.\nPlans may be made to give more water to certain\nindividuals so they can survive to cast spells or fight\nfoes. How characters react to such plans again rests\nwith their alignments.\nA character of this alignment will insist that everyone get an even share of what water there is, even\nthose in the party who seem beyond hope.

Of\ncourse, there are bound to be certain errors and vagaries in such material.\nThat wont be the case in the material presented\nis ruled by a sorcerer-king (or queen) and is organized more or less along the lines outlined under Society of the City States in Chapter Two: Athasian\nSociety. If youve never been to a city, be sure that\nyou read this section before stepping through the\ngates. Otherwise, you could quite easily find yourself making bricks in the mudpits or fighting for\nyour life in the arena.\nOf course, there are many cultural variations\namong the cities, as dictated by the individual tastes\nof the sorcerer-kings. Considering the degree to\nwhich these differences manifest themselves, it is a\nlucky thing that the underlying social structure is so\nsimilar from city to city. Otherwise, traveling from\none to another would be even more hazardous than\nit is now.\nBalic\nBalic is ruled by the Dictator Andropinis, a powerful sorcerer-king who was elected to his post over\nseven-hundred years ago. Though the term dictator originally referred to the power of dictating (as\nin stating) a city policy sanctioned by a democratic\nassembly of property owners, Andropinis has converted the title and off ice into one of total authority.\nAnyone who speaks against him is executed by dictatorial decree.\nOn the rare occasions that someone is brave\nenough to voice a complaint about the harshness of\nAndropinis rule, the old man takes great delight in\nreminding all within earshot that their ancestors\nelected him to his post for life. Unfortunately for the\ncitizens of Balic, nobody realized just how long Andropinis might live.\nAndropinis lives in a majestic palace of white\nmarble, rectangular in shape and adorned on all\nsides by magnificent columns. This palace is located\natop a stony, fortified bluff in the center of the city.\nAndropinis personal army consists of ten thousand\nhighly disciplined foot soldiers who carry twelve-foot\nlances, large wooden shields, and thrusting daggers\nmade from the sharpened thigh bones of erdlus.\n6 7</p>\n<p>Balics templars are unique in that the free citizens of the city elect them to their posts for ten-year\nterms. Andropinis is generally tolerant of these elections, though he sometimes lets the citizens know\nwhich candidates he would like to have elected. I\nhave heard that if the wrong candidate wins the election, Andropinis has him executed and calls another vote.\nThe nobles of Balic are called patricians. Like\nmost other nobles, they hold their lands from generation to generation. Most of them make their living\nfrom the olive orchards and grain farms surrounding the city, but a few own large parcels of the scrub\nplains, upon which they carefully graze kanks and\nother creatures, twenty miles west of the city.\nBalics Merchant Emporiums sit nestled against\nthe base of Andropinis rocky fortress, in an area\ncalled the agora. The merchants do a bustling business in olive oil, kank nectar, and the decorated pottery produced by the citys famous potters. The\nElven Market rings the agora on all sides, so that it\nis impossible to do any legitimate bartering without\nfirst being assaulted with dubious offers.\nBalics secluded location is quite defensible as far\nas the armies of other city-states are concerned, for\nit is impossible to approach the city from any direction except the west. Unfortunately, its close proximity to the Forked Tongue Estuary causes the city\nmore than enough trouble from giants who wade\nashore to raid. Every citizen in the city, male or female, slave or freeman, is a member of the militia.\nOn a rotating basis, they spend every tenth month\nhelping the normal army patrol the fields and scrublands in an effort to reduce the amount of crops and\nstock lost to raiding giants.\nDraj\nThe sorcerer-king of Draj calls himself The\nMighty and Omnipotent Tectuktitlay, Father of Life\nand Master of the Two Moons. As you might\nguess from his appellation, Tectuktitlay claims to be\na god. Lest you take him seriously, Ill point out that\nin my opinion, Tectuktitlay is not even one of the\nmore powerful sorcerer-kings.\nBe that as it may, Tectuktitlay rules Draj from a\ngreat walled compound in the center of the city.\nThis compound contains several one-story buildings\nthat serve as the barracks for his personal guard,\ntemplar quarters, a school for the children of the\nnobles, and a psionics academy that he personally\nsupervises. In the center of this compound is a large\ngladiatorial arena. It is surrounded by tiers of stone\nseats, except where a steep stone pyramid\nTectuktitlays home-rises two hundred feet over it.\nNo one seems to know how long Tectuktitlay has\nruled Draj, probably because he has forbidden this\nknowledge to be passed on from generation to generation in order to make himself seem completely\nimmortal. His templars, called Moon Priests,\nclaim that he raised the city from the dust and made\n6 8</p>\n<p>the surrounding lands fertile.\nThis last claim no doubt arises from the fact that\nDraj sits on a huge mudflat located on the western\nedge of a large inland silt basin (see Geography of\nthe Sea of Silt in Chapter Three: Athasian Geography for an explanation of mudflats).\nIf I had to guess, and I have to, I would say that\nwhat really happened is this: A relatively young\nand weak Defiler, Tectuktitlay, led a small band of\nfollowers to this island and founded his city. Given\nthe natural fertility of mudflats, Draj prospered\nand Tectuktitlay eventually became a sorcererking.\nBecause Draj and the surrounding lands are located on a mudflat, defending it is fairly simple.\nAny army that attempts to leave the road to it inevitably bogs down in a quagmire of thick mud. If the\narmy stays on the stone paved road leading through\nTectuktitlays lands, all he needs do is send his warriors out to defend the narrow passage, then drive\nthe enemy into the mud.\nNevertheless, Draj is almost constantly at war,\nsending its armies far and wide in search of captives.\nThe warriors, which you will encounter nearly anywhere, are armed with obsidian-edged swords and\nshort barbed spears attached to long ropes. They\nare trained to throw their harpoons into a targets\nthigh or seat and then drag him back to where they\nare standing.\nCaptives are returned to Draj itself, where they\nare forced to climb the great pyramid so that Tectuktitlay himself can tear out their hearts. The\nbodies are sent tumbling down the pyramid into the\ngreat arena below.\nOn a day following a particularly large number of\nsacrifices, the bodies are removed from the arena so\nthat the Tectuktitlays favoritesthe Priests of the\nMoons, the nobles, and weapon-makers-can enjoy\nan afternoon of gladiatorial games.\nDespite its warlike nature, Draj enjoys heavy\ncommerce with the other cities of the Tyr Region\n(and some cities to the north, whose names I do not\nknow). This is because Drajs fertile soil makes it\nrich in two essential resources: hemp, which is good\nfor making both clothes and rope, and grain, which\nmost other cities desperately need in order to feed\ntheir starving populations.\nGulg\nThe sorcerer-queen of Gulg, Lalali-Puy, is called\nthe oba by her subjects. The oba is an absolute\nmonarch whose name means forest goddess in\nthe language of her people. This is not a title she\nassumed herself, but one that her subjects thrust\nupon her. Lalali-Puy can command anything she\nwishes and know that she will be instantly obeyed by\nher people. In their eyes, she is a goddess: they attribute her long life to immortality, and they believe\nthat only a being of supreme power could have the\nabilities that she displays.\n6 9</p>\n<p>Lalali-Puy is perhaps the only city ruler who enjoys the popular support of her subjects. Gulg is engaged in an ages-old territorial war with Nibenay,\nthe city at the other end of the forest. As terrible as\ntheir oba is, the inhabitants of Gulg are convinced\nthat she is all that stands between them and being\ntotally enslaved by Nibenay. In this, they are undoubtedly correct.\nGulg is not a city in the ordinary sense of the\nword. It lies at the southern tip of the Crescent Forest, more or less in the center of the territory portrayed on the Map of the Tyr Region. The-outer\nwalls of the city consist of a thick hedge of thorny\ntrees. The branches of these trees grow so tightly\ninterwoven that it is impossible for anything larger\nthan a halflings fist to penetrate the barrier.\nWhile most of the inhabitants of the city live in\ncircular mud huts capped by roofs of thatched\nvines, Lalali-Puy herself lives in a small but magnificent palace built in the highest limbs of a huge agafari tree.\nHer templars, who oversee the military, economic,\nand agricultural matters of the city, live in wellappointed huts in the lower limbs of the tree. Although the particular level of a templars hut bears\nno direct relationship to his status, one can tell a\ntemplars approximate rank by counting the number of necklaces he wears. Lalali-Puys most trusted\nadvisor, and second in command, wears ten necklaces. The lowliest templars wear only one.\nIn Gulg, the nobles are not landowners, for the\ntemplars city-owned slaves gather the citys food\nsupplywild fruits, nuts, and berriesfrom the forest. Instead, the nobles are composed of an elite\nclass of hunters who are selected from the general\npopulation at an early age and laboriously trained\nin the arts of tracking, moving silently, and surviving\nin the timberlands for many days without food or\nwater. As you might suspect, nobility is not inherited\nin Gulg, for only the most capable youths are selected to undertake the grueling training required to become a hunter.\nLike all property in Gulg, the food that the\nhunters and slaves gather is considered to be owned\nby the oba, who then redistributes it so that the basic needs of citizens are met. Of course, this makes\nit difficult for merchants to operate in the city, but\nthe oba has solved this problem in a very efficient\nmanner. In Gulg, the senior agent of a merchant\nhouse deals directly with a templar assigned to his\nemporium, who barters on behalf of all the people of\nthe city. These templars are well known as hard bargainers, for more than one merchant house has\ngone broke trying to trade in pepper, kola nuts, and\nexotic feathers with the merchants of Gulg.\nThe warriors of Gulg are known as judaga or\nhead hunters. They are half-hunter and half-fighter,\ndepending upon stealth to ambush their enemies\nand bows and arrows or poisoned darts to slay\nthem. Their name comes from their habit of claim70</p>\n<p>ing the heads of fallen enemies to prove their boasts\nof combat prowess.\nNibenay\nThe city of Nibenay is named after its founder,\nthe sorcerer-king Nibenay. Called the Shadow\nKing by his subjects, Nibenay is a bizarre and enigmatic figure. His subjects see him so rarely that the\ncity is constantly filled with rumors that he has died.\nWhenever these rumors result in a civil disturbance,\nhowever, Nibenay appears long enough to impress\nupon his subjects that he is still very much alive\nusually by singlehandedly crushing the rebellion.\nThe Shadow King lives inside a walled sub-city\nlocated in the center of Nibenay. No free man has\never seen his palace in person, but according to rumor it sits atop an artificial mountain of stone slabs.\nThe palace itself is supposedly a giant bust of Nibenays head. The front of the castle is carved into a\nstone relief of the Shadow Kings face. The sides\nand rear of the palace are covered with life-sized\nrepresentations of dancing women, strung together\nas if they were locks of his hair.\nNibenays templars are all women. It is unclear\nwhether they are all Nibenays wives, but it seems\nentirely possible. Only the templars are permitted to\nenter and leave the sub-city in which his palace is\nlocated. Otherwise, the rest of the city is composed\nentirely of slaves dedicated to making the lives of Nibenay and his templars comfortable and secure.\nSome say that many of these slaves are sculptors\nwho are kept busy carving reliefs of each templar\ninto the locks of Nibenays hair covering the side\nand rear of the palace.\nThis is completely feasible, as strange tastes in architecture seem to be the norm in Nibenay. Every\nbuilding is carved with stone reliefs. Although the\ncraftsmanship is flawless, the subject matter is peculiar. Often, the relief portrays the self-satisfied smirk\nof a wealthy noble-usually the person who owned\nthe building when it was first built. Sometimes, the\nbuilding is carved with the figures of the builders\nentire family, all engaged in some sort of strange\ndance. In other instances, the building is decorated\nwith fantastic reliefs of various monsters in the superstitious belief that if the city is visited by one of\nthe terrible beasts it will be flattered by the depiction\nand leave the inhabitants in peace.\nNibenay sits just outside the northern edge of the\nCrescent Forest, atop several hundred acres of bubbling springs. The nobles each own one of these\nsprings, which they use to irrigate the fields of rice\nthat feed the city.\nNibenays merchant trade is based on the sale of\nweapons made from wood obtained in the Crescent\nForest. Nibenays craftsmen are busy day and night\nfelling agafari trees and shaping their extremely\nhard wood-the next best thing to bronze-into\nshields, spears, and clubs. This is-the basis of Nibenays rivalry with Gulg, for the hunters and gath7 1</p>\n<p>erers of the forest city fear that if left unchecked,\nNibenays devastating practices would soon leave\nthem without a home.\nThe core of Nibenays army consists of a thousand half-giants armed with agafari lances and\nclubs.\nRaam\nThe sorcerer-queen of Raam, Abalach-Re, calls\nherself the Great Vizier. She lives in a beautiful palace with ivory walls and an alabaster roof built atop\na grassy knoll overlooking the city. Unfortunately,\nthe base of this knoll is surrounded by a complicated\nand ugly series of defensive breastworks, ditches,\nand walls, for Abalach-Re is the most insecure of all\nthe city rulers. When I visited there, the people\nspoke of organizing a rebellion and openly praised\nthe last attempt to overthrow their queen (though it\napparently occurred previous to most of their lives,\nfor no one could remember how it had ended).\nAbalach-Re professes to be the representative of\nsome greater power, and claims that her powers are\ngifts from this mysterious being. According to\nAbalach-Res theory, this mysterious being has\npicked her to watch over the city of Raam and its\npeople. When she is no longer performing his task\nwell, this same mysterious being will strike her dead\nand assign someone new to the office of Great Vizier.\nThis is one of the more original ploys a sorcererking has used to legitimize his or her power. By\nclaiming to be the humble servant of a higher power,\nand by claiming that this same being approves of\nwhat she is doing, Abalach-Re hopes to focus the\ninevitable discontent of his subjects away from herself. Unfortunately for her, the citizens of Raam are\nsmarter than she thinks. Although they pay lip service to the being she professes to serve, and may even\nattend the ceremonies the templars of Raam organize to honor this mythical creature, few people truly believe in its existence. Instead, they secretly\ndespise Abalach-Re for being such a weak ruler\nthat she must resort to these ploys, and they flout\nthe authority of the Great Vizier whenever they feel\nthey can get away with it.\nAs a consequence, Raam is the most chaotic city I\nhave visited. Templars hardly dare to show themselves alone in the streets for fear of being assassinated by the nobles. The nobles are little better than\nraiding tribes. Each noble owns at least a small tract\nof land abutting the roads, and his guards demand a\nhefty price from anyone who wishes to cross the nobles land. The merchant houses hire small armies of\nmercenaries to defend their trading emporiums from\narmed bands of thieves. The situation is so bad that\nelves are commonly accepted in the ranks of high society as if they were upstanding citizens!\nOf course, it is the slaves who suffer most under\nthese conditions. Because most of Raams fields lie\nuntended and wild, food is expensive and difficult to\ncome by in large quantities. Consequently, slaves\n7 2</p>\n<p>are fed only what is absolutely necessary to keep\nthem alive-and then only as long as they are needed. As soon as their usefulness is at an end, they are\nsent to the arena to entertain the mad crowd with a\npitiful exhibition of fighting.\nThe only thing that prevents Raam from being\noverrun by another city-state is the sheer numbers of\nthe army it can field. Abalach-Re maintains a huge\narmory beneath her palace and, if desperate, can\narm every citizen in Raam with a wooden shield,\nflint-tipped throwing spear, and an obsidian-spiked\nflail. Of course, she is loathe to place such might in\nthe hands of a populous that clearly despises her,\nbut the option exists nonetheless.\nT y r\nTyr is ruled by the sorcerer-king Kalak, who calls\nhimself simply King Kalak or, as he sometimes prefers to be addressed, the Tyrant of Tyr. A pragmatic and ruthless man, Kalak is perhaps the most\nhonest of all sorcerer-kings. He rules by the might of\nhis magic and tremendous psionic powers, placing\nhis own security and the stability of Tyr above all\nother considerations.\nIf Kalaks attitude seems unjust or inequitable, it\nis at least predictable. The residents of his city understand that the best way to insure their own survival is to do what benefits Kalak. The surest way to\nfind themselves working in the slave pits is to oppose\nKalaks will. As a consequence, Tyrian society has\nfunctioned very efficiently for the thousand years\nthat Kalak has ruled the city.\nThe Tyrant of Tyr has always made his home in a\nmagnificent palace adjacent to the gladiatorial stadium. The eastern wall of this palace overlooks the\narena itself. During the games, Kalak himself can\noften be seen sitting on one of the hundred balconies that overlook the arena, accompanied by a\nhandful of templars and other favorites.\nOf late, old King Kalak seems to have become\nsenile. For the past twenty years, he has diverted\nmuch of the citys slave labor to building a mighty\nziggurat (directly across the arena from his palace),\nclaiming that it will protect Tyr from attacks by the\ndragon. At first, the nobles were tolerant of his folly,\nfor the burden it placed on them was not great.\nOver the last year, however, Kalak has grown frantic\nto finish the massive structure, appropriating so\nmany slaves that there is almost nobody left to work\nthe fields.\nKalak has also taken the slaves out of the mines,\ncompletely shutting down iron production. This has\ncaused the citys economy to crash, leaving merchant and noble alike destitute. The slaves are\nstarving, and even free craftsmen receive only meager grain rations in return for their services-and\nthen only if their work contributes directly to the\nconstruction of the ziggurat.\nTo make matters worse, other cities that depend\n73</p>\n<p>upon imports of Tyrs raw iron to supplement their\neconomies are up in arms. Many of them, most notably Urik and Raam, have sent emissaries to King\nKalak with rave warnings concerning the consequences of failing to resume iron production.\nCan it be any wonder that in their private gatherings, nobles are whispering plans of rebellion and\nthat merchants are fleeing the city in droves? Surely,\neven the iron grip of the templars cannot keep the\ncity from erupting into a violent inferno for much\nlonger.\nWhen the final battle comes, it will be a terrible\nthing. The Royal Guard consists of two thousand\nmercenaries led by five hundred half-giants and Kalaks loyal templars. In fact, the latter are all armed\nwith steel swords. Against them will be arrayed the\nvaried armies of the nobles-who are far superior in\nnumber, if not armament. Considering the advantages of Kalaks magic, the contest will be a close\none. Ironically, it may well be decided by the lowliest\nof all Tyrs citizens, the slaves.\nUrik\nPerhaps King Hamanu of Urik is best described\nin his own words:\nI am Hamanu, King of the World, King of the\nMountains and the Plains, King of Urik, for whom\nthe roaring winds and the all-mighty sun have decreed a destiny of heroism, and to whom the lifegiving waters and the nourishing soils have trusted\nthe mightiest City of Athas.\nThe Great Spirits of the bountiful lands raised\nme from my childhood, instructing me in the art of\nwar, how to give the signal for the skirmish, and\nwhen to draw up the line of battle. They made my\narms powerful against my enemies, who have always\nbeen many, and gave me weapons to strike off the\nheads of those whom I fight. They made of me a\nman who cannot be killed, and a general who cannot be defeated.\nI am Hamanu of Urik, The Great King, The\nMighty King, King of the World, King of Athas, an\nunrivaled potentate who holds sway from the great\nRinging Mountains to the shores of the endless Sea\nof Silt, the bringer of death and peace, to whom all\nmust submit.\nAs you have probably guessed, Hamanu considers himself a warrior king. Providing he finds the\nbattle worthy of his skills, he often leads his troops\ninto combat personally. So far, he has earned his\nboasting rightshis armies have never been defeated when he was leading them.\nHamanus palace stands inside a great walled fortress in the center of Urik. This fortress covers a\nsquare mile, serving as both the administrative center for his templars and the base for his army. It contains a drill field, a barracks, and an armory filled\nwith obsidian-edged swords, spears, and bows and\n7 4</p>\n<p>arrows. From this fortress, Hamanu can personally\nsend more than ten thousand slave soldiers led by a\nthousand lance-carrying half-giants into battle.\nWhether their status is slave or mercenary, all of\nthese soldiers are extremely loyal to Hamanu, for he\ntrains with them personally almost every day.\nAltaruk\nLocated at the head of the Big Fork of the Forked\nTongue Estuary, Altaruk is a client village of the\nmerchant houses of Wavir, Rees, and Tomblador\n(based in Balic). As villages go, Altaruk is heavily\nfortified; it is surrounded by a fifteen-foot wall and\ndefended by five hundred free mercenaries armed\nwith mekillot-hide shields, wooden lances, and daggers of sharpened bone.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Hamanus\narmy is his company of halflings. He has worked out\nan agreement with Chief Urga-Zoltapl whereby\nUrik supplies him with a certain quantity of obsidian in return for the services of two hundred halfling\nwarriors. Hamanu uses these halflings to disrupt his\nopponents rear areas by having them infiltrate during the night to attack the tents of rival commanders, destroy supply wagons, and free his\nenemys slaves.\nUriks economy depends almost entirely on obsidian quarried from the Mountain of the Black\nCrown. It also relies heavily on Tyrs iron to make\nthe tools necessary to quarry the glassy stone efficiently.\nThis contingent of warriors is commanded by Arisphistaneles, a powerful Preserver. Because of Arisphistaneles influence, the Veiled Alliance is openly\ntolerated in Altaruk, and the city is fast becoming\nknown as a safe meeting place for Preserversthough\nDefilers are strictly forbidden entry.\nDespite its formidable defenses, Altaruk is destroyed on a regular basis by giants from the islands\nof the Forked Tongue Estuary. The sponsors always\nrebuild the village promptly, for its garrison is a key\ndeterrent to the raiders that would otherwise prey on\nthe heavy caravan traffic at this critical junction.\nThis protection is extended to caravans of other\nhouses in return for payment of a heavy toll as they\npass through Altaruk.\nMakla\nAs a final note, I should warn you that if you visit\nUrik, be very careful to obey all of Hamanus laws\nand keep some gold hidden securely away just in\ncase you must bribe a templar for your freedom.\nFew fates are worse than being sold into slavery to\nwork in the quarry pits. The sharp edges of the\nglassy stone will slice your fingers, hands, and arms\nto a point of uselessness within days.\nVillages\nThere are hundreds of villages in the Tyr Region.\nEven if it were possible to describe them all, there\nwould be little point in doing so. By the time you\nvisited any particular village, there is a good chance\nthat it would be gonehaving been destroyed by\nraiders or simply deserted after serving its purpose.\nTherefore, only the villages that seemed to me more\nor less permanent are described below.\nMakla is a client village of Urik, located on the\nshore of the Lake of Golden Dreams. It is a rugged\ntown serving as a supply center and base camp for\nthe slave gangs quarrying obsidian from the Smoking Crown. Makla is rarely harassed by raiders, for\n500 Urik soldiers armed with obsidian-edged swords\nand spears are stationed here. They are supplemented by so half-giants armed with lances and\nclubs and a force of 25 halfling hunters assigned to\ntrack down escaped slaves.\nNorth and South Ledopolus\nThese two dwarven villages are located on opposite sides of the Big Fork of the Forked Tongue Estuary. The inhabitants of North Ledopolus are trying\n7 5</p>\n<p>reached by scaling a five-hundred foot cliff, by flyto build a stone pathway to Ledo Island from their\nnorth shore of the estuary, and the inhabitants of\nSouth Ledopolus are trying to do the same from the\nsouth shore of the estuary. Their intention is to\nbridge the entire estuary, opening a shorter caravan\nroute from Gulg and Nibenay to Balic and other\ncities south of the Tyr Region.\nOccasionally, the giants living on Ledo Island\nwade out to tear down some of what the dwarves\nhave built. This usually occasions a fierce battle between the two contingents.\nSalt View\nSalt View is a slave tribe village located on the\neastern face of the Mekillot Mountains. Like most\nslave villages, it is a boisterous, unruly place filled\nwith ex-slaves of all races, yet it is also known for its\nfine theater. The former slaves of Salt View have recently begun to supplement their normal means of\nmaking a living (raiding caravans bound for Gulg\nor Nibenay) by sending out acting troupes to put on\nshows for wealthy merchants (they will have nothing\nto do with nobles). Salt Views leader is an exgladiator mul named Xaynon.\nOgo is the home of the halfling chief, UrgaOgo\nOgo is unique among halfling villages in that an\noutsider may hope to visit it without being eaten\nbut I would suggest undertaking the journey only in\nthe company of halflings from Urik. Otherwise,\nyoull be taking your chances as to whether UrgaZoltapl thinks you would be more interesting as a\nconversationalist or as a meal.\nZoltapl. It consists of a massive step-pyramid rising\njust high enough so that its summit sits beneath the\nshade of the forest canopy (about seventy-five feet).\nUrga-Zoltapls palace sits atop this pyramid, and it\nis here that he receives his tribesmen. A dozen stone\nbuildings, homes for his servants and wives, stand\nscattered around the base of the pyramid.\nThe largest and most reliable oases are marked\non the Map of the Tyr Region. There is little reason\nAthas is an arid world, but it is not entirely waterless. In various places, springs and underground\nstreams bubble to the surface, forming small pools\naround which a verdant belt of vegetation grows.\nThe desert is fairly dotted with oases-but they are\nso small and spread so far apart that unless you\nknow their exact locations, you are apt to die of\nthirst looking for them. Then, too, oases come and\ngo with frustrating irregularity. Sometimes the underground water source dries up; other times, the\nwind buries them beneath tons of sand and dust.\nEven when you do find an oasis, it is wise to remember that the water is sometimes poisonous.\nOases\nTomblador merchant house, which also pays a small\ncompany of Defilers to live in the village and protect\nit. Like the iron mine of Tyr, the gold mine here\ngives up its precious treasure only at great cost in\nsweat and blood.\nwill oblige only if the individual is known to them.\nThe reason for all this secrecy and security is that\nWalis sits atop the only gold mine in Athas that I\nknow of. Lest you get any ideas about getting rich\nquickly, however, I should warn you that all commercial transactions in the village are handled by the\ntom of the cliff and ask to be lifted, and the natives\ning, or by being hoisted in a cargo-bucket that the\nnatives operate for that purpose. Those who do\nknow of Waliss true nature must stand at the botpass right beneath it without a second thought. Walis sits atop a high spire of rock that can only be\nMountainand thats the way the citizens like it.\nFrom the outside, it looks like the long-deserted ruin\nof an ancient castle, and many travelers no doubt\nThis small village is hidden away up an obscure\nside canyon in the foothills of the Ringing\nWalis\n7 6</p>\n<p>to describe each oasis individually, however, so I\nhave included in the atlas only those that have some\nunique feature, which you may be likely to visit in\nyour own travels.\nBitter Well\nLake Pit\nThe waters at this oasis are actually very cool and\nsweet. For centuries, as the caravan drivers crossed\nthe scrub plains surrounding this oasis, they could\nhear running water. They could never locate its\nsource, however, until a small group of dwarves set\nup a village and dug a well through a thin mantle of\nrock. It turned out that there was an underground\nstream below the rock mantle, which was acting as a\nsounding board to amplify the sounds of the stream.\nThe dwarves, who had hoped to make a fortune selling water to the caravan drivers, were understandably bitter when they realized that the stream was\ntoo small to support even their own families, much\nless earn them the fortune they had hoped for;\nhence the name of the oasis.\nThis lake, located at the northern end of the\nDragons Bowl, is the largest body of water in the\nTyr Region. Its cerulean surface covers more than\ntwenty-eight square miles. Despite the fact that it is\nless than thirty miles from Urik, it remains in pristine condition, its shores teeming with both flora\nand fauna. Perhaps the reason for this is that to\nreach it, travelers must descend the steep cliffs of the\nDragons Bowl, or perhaps it is because Lake Pit is\nalso under the protection of the druid who lives in\nthe Dragons Bowl (see Landmarks below).\nIn either case, if you visit Lake Pit, do nothing to\nbefoul the crystalline waters. And for your own protection, dont even think about trying to reach the\nSunken City rumored to lie in the submerged caves\nbeneath the lake. All those stories about rooms full\nof gold and halls filled with treasure are probably\njust fairy tales, anyway.\nLake of Golden Dreams\nI would advise against relying upon watering at\nthis well when making your travel plans; there is at\nleast a 50% chance that the caravan ahead of you\nhas already depleted the well. When this happens,\nit often takes up to six days before enough water\nj-lows back into the well to fill a typical caravans\nwaterskins.\nBlack Waters\nBlack Waters is located in the heart of the Yaramuke (see Ruins below), halfway between the cities\nof Urik and Raam. Whatever you do, dont drink\nfrom either the pool or the stream that runs out of it.\nWhen King Hamanu of Urik destroyed Yaramuke,\nhe used such terrible magic that he poisoned this\noasis forever. Now, whoever drinks this water feels a\nchill fall over him and grows deathly ill. You would\nalso be well advised to avoid camping near this oasis; it is haunted by the spectres of those who did not\nread (or heed) this warning.\nThe Lake of Golden Dreams lies on the western\nside of the Smoking Crown, where a thick yellowish\nsteam constantly rises from its boiling waters.\nWhere the yellow water is not too deep, it is possible\nto see that the bottom of the lake is laced with hundreds of tunnels and passageways. According to rumor, these tunnels lead to an incredible city that lies\nat the heart of the Smoking Crown. It is difficult to\nsay whether there is any truth to this story, however;\nthose who have survived the scalding waters long\nenough to swim into the tunnels have never\nreturned.\nSilver Spring\nThere is nothing silver about this oasis: the water\nis foul-tasting and brown, the bushes in the surrounding scrub plains are dun-colored and thorny,\nand the rocks are burnt orange, just like in the stony\nbarrens of the rest of Athas. The reason the oasis is\ncalled the Silver Spring is because the elven chief\n7 7</p>\n<p>who settled his tribe here demands a piece of silver\n(or something equivalent) of anyone who wishes to\nwater at the pool. He and his warriors generally attack anyone who fails to pay.\nGraks Pool\nThe pond at this oasis is protected by a large\nmud-brick fortress. If you want to water here, it costs\none copper piece (or the equivalent) per animal\n(they count intelligent beings as animals). Otherwise, the half-elf Grak and his fifty mercenaries\nwont allow you insideunless, of course, they realize that you are more powerful than they are. According to rumors, there is a vault beneath Graks\nfortress that contains all the treasure he has gained\nthrough controlling this oasis over the years.\nLost Oasis\nThis geyser sits in the middle of a salt flat. Over\nthe years, the steaming waters have washed the salt\naway for several miles around the fountain, and now\nit is surrounded by a beautiful forest of pinion trees.\nThe Lost Oasis and its grove are protected by the\nthri-kreen druid Durwadala, whom you will never\nsee-even if she attacks you for defiling the oasis.\nThe Mud Palace\nThis huge mudflat is located in an inland silt basin in one of the most deserted parts of the Tyr Region. Even if you can persuade a friendly giant to\ncarry you to it, as I did, I advise against going there.\nThe entire mudflat is populated by horrid monsters,\nthe like of which you have never seen before.\nAt the center of the island, where the foliage\n7 8</p>\n<p>Some claim that an ancient sorceress is imprisoned on the island, and that she is singing her beautiful song to call a hero to her aid. Others say the\nsong is nothing but the cry of some foul creature\ninhabiting the island. Whatever the reason, be\nforewarnedthe song is fatal.\nThis long, narrow island is formed by a small\nrange of very high mountains. The northern face of\nthe mountains receives quite a bit of rein and has\nthree fairly large streams that cascade down the\nDragons Palate\nThis rocky crag is inhabited by a clan of ten to\nfifteen giants (the inhabitants were intentionally\nvague as to their number and took steps to prevent\nme from getting an accurate count). They are convinced that the dwarves of Northern and Southern\nLedopolus (see Villages above) are trying to reach\nLedo in order to steal their mineral wealth, which\nconsists of a single flint-laced mountain. Ledo is\ntoo rocky for grazing, so the giants make their living by hunting and by trading bags of flint to merchant caravans traveling the road from Balic to\nAltaruk.\nThough I have not actually visited this island, it\nseems wise to warn you about it. Caravan drivers\ntraveling the area north of this island have taken to\nplugging their ears as they pass, for a strange,\nhaunting song drifts out over the stony barrens from\nSirens Song. This song casts a magical spell over\nthose who hear it, and they find themselves compelled to follow it to its source. Unfortunately, the\nsource lies on Sirens Song Island, and as the enchanted men attempt to wade out to the island, they\ninevitably suffocate in the half-mile of silt that they\nmust cross to reach it. Foolishly, I was determined\nto hear this song, so I deliberately left my ears uncovered. I nearly killed my companions before they\nsucceeded in restraining me and saving me from this\nterrible fate. To this day, its memory haunts me and\nI often feel a longing to seek out its source.\nSirens Song\nL e d o\nI have learned the names of many, however, and\nthese islands are listed on the Map of the Tyr Region. Most of them are inhabited by giants, I believe. But not every island on the map is described\nhere; as I have said earlier, in this atlas I am including only places that I have visited personally. Therefore, the list below includes only a few of the many\nislands in the Tyr Region.\nThe Sea of Silt is filled with islands, and I must admit, not having the ability to fly (magically or otherwise), that my visits to them have been limited.\nI should warn you, however, against trying to capture or kill any of the exotic birds that inhabit the\nnorthern slope of the mountains. Although the tail\nfeathers of these birds are worth a small fortune in\nany city, the giants seem strangely attached to their\nfeathered friends. If they catch you bird hunting,\nthey will most assuredly toss you into the Sea of Silt\nto suffocate.\nIslands\nsteep slopes before forming mudflats in the Forked\nTongue Estuary.\nThe giants on this island make their living by\nherding sheep and tending olive orchards. They\nrarely resort to raiding, except in search of some material they cannot produce themselves. They are especially fond of kank nectar and are sure to welcome\nany visitor bearing a tub of the rich green honey.\ngrows so thick it is a veritable jungle, a magnificent\ncastle of white marble rises out of the mud. What\nmay lie inside is impossible to say. The grounds are\nhaunted by venomous spiders and snakes of every\nsort. To make matters worse, there are no windows,\ndoors, or entrances of any sort on the castle-save\nfor the windows at the highest levels of the tower,\nwhich gush forth a constant stream of water.\n7 9</p>\n<p>Waverly\nIn the center of this large island sits an ancient,\nwalled city. In the town square, the primitive fountain still sprays water into the air. The towns sewers\nact like a network of irrigation canals to carry away\nthe overflow, so the region in and about the town\nhas become a well-watered scrub plain over the\nyears. At the edges of the city lie several piers and\nancient craft that may have been used for sailing\nwhen the sea was filled with water. Although these\nwere clearly crafted of wood once, they have become\npetrified either with the passage of time or via some\narcane enchantment. The area between these piers\nand the Sea of Silt is rocky and barren.\nto see if they can sneak upon these individuals and\npush them into the scalding waters of the lake.\nRuins\nAs noted in the chapter on geography, there are\nruins all over Athas. You will encounter them practically wherever you go, lying half-submerged in\ndust basins, rising out of the endless salt flats, or\ntowering above the stony barrens. The ruins described below are some of the more interesting ones\nthat I have visited.\nBleak Tower\nThis circular, marble tower rises more than a hundred feet above the surrounding plain. Once, a\nwooden stairway ascended the interior, but it has\nlong since rotted away. Other than the stairway, the\ntower remains exactly as it has stood for at least a\nthousand years. Not a stone has fallen from its\nwalls. From its crown, a magical lantern still casts a\nmacabre green light out over the Sea of Silt. When\nthe wind stirs up a good dust storm, a loud, painful\nbellow sounds from the tower at regular intervals.\nThe local natives attribute the roar to the ghost of\nthe towers lady who, they say, lost her betrothed on\nsuch a night long ago, when the Sea of Silt was filled\nwith water.\nAccording to legend, a horde of several thousand\npounds of silver is buried somewhere beneath the\ncity. Even if this legend is true and you found the\nhorde, however, I think you would have more trouble\ntransporting it back to shore than finding it in the\nfirst place. Other than a flock of wild erdlus and\nseveral hives of wild kanks, the island appears completely deserted.\nLake Island\nLake Island is a huge volcano that has gradually\nthrust itself up out of the Sea of Silt over the course\nof the last five hundred years. Though it has never\nerupted violently to my knowledge, the summit\ngrows a little higher each year as a fairly constant\nstream of magma trickles forth from cracks in the\nside of the cone. The scrub plains of the islands\nlower slopes are covered with a lush grass that serves\nkanks and erdlus well as fodder.\nIn the crater at the mountains summit there is a\nlarge, deep lake of clear blue water. A plume of bluish steam rises from this lake and hangs over the\nmountains crown at all times. Some psionicists\nclaim that breathing these vapors while perched on\nthe edge of the crater in a state of trance helps them\nachieve a deeper understanding of their inner\npowers. The giants on the island think it is great fun\nArkhold\nThis ancient village of stone huts was once protected by a large castle perched atop a hill overlooking the town. The village seems to have been a\nhealthy one, for it had outgrown its walls several\ntimes and built new ones to protect the outer buildings. Now, much of the village is covered by drifting\nsand. My guides told me that every time they come\nback, a new part of the town is uncovered and a\nsection that they had previously explored is buried\nin sand. Arkholds isolation makes it a good place\nfor treasure hunters. Although we tarried here only\na few hours, my guides each found a steel sword (I\n80</p>\n<p>suspect that one of them was magic) in parts of the\nvillage that had only recently become uncovered.\nAs for the castle itself, I cannot tell you much\nabout it. When I tried to climb the hill to explore it,\nmy guides restrained me bodily, claiming that it was\nthe home to a foul race of insane humanoids. Then,\nas nightfall began to approach, they insisted upon\nleaving the area altogether, fearing that those same\nhumanoids would come and take us kicking and\nscreaming back to their castle. I would like to return\nthere someday, however, for the castle looked amazingly well preserved. I am sure that it would prove to\nbe an excellent place to learn something about the\nancients.\nKalidnay\nKalidnay was once a magnificent city-state, as\nGiustenal\nI have talked to those who say that the undead are\ncontrolled by a powerful Defiler who is using them\nto keep treasure hunters away from the city while he\nsystematically loots it. Others claim that the undead\nare the original inhabitants of the city, and they cannot rest because there is some terrible secret buried\nin the heart of ancient city that they do not want\ndiscovered. In either case, if you go to Bodach, be\nprepared for an intense battle against this gruesome\narmy.\nskeletons crawl out of the cellars, sewers, and hidden dungeons, then begin scouring the city and the\nsurrounding countryside. If you are here after dark,\nyou will spend the entire night fighting one long,\npitched battle.\nGiustenal is another of the great cities of the ancients. The city has many different walls, some of\nwhich wind down into the Sea of Silt. It is possible to\nwade several miles into the dust by walking along the\ntops of these walls, but I would advise against such\nfoolishness. There seems to be an unusual concentration of silt horrors around the city.\nlarge as Tyr and as wealthy as Balic. The sorcererking who ruled it lived in an immense palace in the\nheart of the city, surrounded by the mansions of his\nnobles and templars. Judging from all of the abandoned trading emporiums, it must have been a\nwealthy city indeed. In the center of the city, there\nwas even a huge ziggurat. Now, the streets are littered with skeletons, the palaces have fallen into ruin, and the ziggurat has been cracked open like an\nimmense earthen egg. No one knows what disaster\ncaused the downfall of Kalidnay, but there can be\nno doubt that it came rapidly and unexpectedly.\nBodach\nI have never felt this pull, but one night while we\nwere camped inside the city ruins, a glassy look\ncame over my psionicist companion and he began\nconversing with an unseen partner in a strange language. Two days later, he went insane and murdered\nour kank drivers. I was forced to kill him to defend\nGiustenal appears relatively deserted, per haps\neven peaceful, and it is. However, there is something\nlurking out there in the quarters buried by the Sea\nof Silt. Psionicists claim that it is a beingor an\nobject-of incredible power that makes contact with\nvulnerable minds and calls to them.\nBodach, lying at the tip of a peninsula projecting\ninto one of the great inland silt basins, was undoubtedly one of the mightiest cities of the ancients. Its\nruins cover many square miles of the peninsula.\nWhen you stand at the edge of the silt basin, you\ncan see its towers rising above the silt for many miles\nbeyond.\nmyself.\nUnfortunately, Bodach and the surrounding territories are not good places to linger. As the crimson\nsun goes down, thousands of undead zombies and\nYaramuke\nThis ruined city was once ruled by the Queen of\nYaramuke, a beautiful sorcerer named Sielba. She\n81</p>\n<p>and King Hamanu of Urik became embroiled in a\nbitter dispute concerning quarrying rights to the obsidian on the Smoking Crown. Hamanu resolved\nthe dispute by razing Yaramuke to the ground, using such terrible magic that even the water was\nfouled forever. According to legend, Sielbas treasure is still buried beneath the ruins of her palace. If\nyou journey to Yaramuke in search of this treasure, I\nwish you good luck in determining which pile of rubble was once Sielbas palace.\nLandmarks\nNever et it be said that Athas is a dreary or monotonous land. It is strewn with interesting and\nbeautiful landmarks, as Im sure you will discover\nduring your travels. Here are a few of my favorites.\nDragons Bowl\nThis great basin was formed when the first great\ndragon was born, tearing his body out of the living\nrock. Obviously, I was not present at this event, but\nwhen I entered the valley eons later, an intangible\nsense of awe crept over me, filling me with emotions\nof such apprehension and triviality that I fell trembling to my knees.\nPerhaps this is why, despite lying between three\nbusy caravan routes, Dragons Bowl remains a\nhushed and desolate place. Or perhaps it is because\nno matter how you enter the Dragons Bowl, you\nmust descend a thousand feet of steep, treacherous\nslopes that often end in sheer, rocky cliffs. In either\ncase, you will find the bottom of this large valley eerily quiet, especially around Lake Pit at the northern end (see Oases above). The entire region is\nunder the protection of the mul Enola.\nMekillot Mountains\nFrom a distance, these mountains look like a huge\nmekillot crawling across the plains. The core of\nthese mountains is composed of hard granite, and\nwherever this bedrock is exposed, it protrudes from\nIf you make it this far into the Hinterlands, take\nthe time and effort to struggle up the broken ground\nof this river. At its heart lies a beautiful pine forest,\nfilled with gentle creatures. Deep within the forest\nlies an alabaster palace. When I visited, the gates to\nthis palace were closed and it appeared deserted,\nbut I could peer inside and see that the gardens were\nbeautifully maintained. Though I camped outside\nthe gates for more than a week, I never did see any\ninhabitants. I reluctantly decided to leave when I noticed a huge, dark shape circling high overhead.\nAs far as I know, I am the only living man who\nhas ever seen this ancient volcano. Shrouded in\nblack cinders, it rises out of the scrub plains of the\nHinterlands like a lonely sentinel. On the northwest\nside, the steep wall of its slopes is broken by the jagged outflow of an ancient river of lava.\nDragons Crown Mountain\nThis silt-filled channel is over two hundred fifty\nmiles long, and is one of the primary barriers to\ntraveling north and south in the southern areas of\nthe Tyr region. It is filled with small islands, only a\nsmall portion of which are shown on the Map of the\nTyr Region. Most of these islands are inhabited by\nat least one or two giants. On breezy evenings, when\nthe crimson sun is just setting and a silver haze of\ndust hangs over the channel, it is one of the most\nbeautiful sights on Athas.\nEstuary of the Forked Tongue\nIt is well worth the trying trip across the salt plains\nto walk among these natural monoliths, but beware\nof two things when you arrive: klars and Salt View.\nKlars are huge nocturnal bears that hunt via psionics and Salt View is a slave village.\nthe surrounding soft rock in beautifully carved\nshapesdomes and pillars, huge walls, immense\ntilted slabs, etc.\n8 2</p>\n<p>83</p>"}, "title": {"show": false}, "image": {"displayMode": 0}, "sort": 9000}], "sort": 9000}

The eleven-part, or\nendlean cycle, is counted and spoken first, in the\norder presented below. The seven-part, or seofean\ncycle, is counted and spoken second. The endlean\ncycle is complete when Athas two moons, Ral and\nGuthay, meet in the heavensa major eclipse that\noccurs once every 11 years. The seofean cycle is\nmore abstract, meeting when agitation in the cosmos leads to fury.\nEvery 77 years the cycle repeats itself, ending with\na year of Guthays Agitation and starting again\nwith a new year of Rals Fury. Each 77-year cycle is\ncalled a kings age; there have been 183 complete\nkings ages since Tyr adopted this calendar (more\nthan 14,500 years).\nSo, the first year of each kings age is a year of\nRals Fury. The next year is a year of Friends Contemplation, followed by a year of Deserts Vengeance, etc. The 76th year of each kings age is a year\nof Enemys Reverence, followed by the 77th year, a\nyear of Guthays Agitation.\nYear of the Messenger\nRal\nFriend\nDesert\nPriest\nW i n d\nDragon\nMountain\nKing\nSilt\nEnemy\nGuthay\nFury\nContemplation\nVengeance\nSlumber\nDefiance\nReverence\nAgitation\nSuperstition and folklore surrounds each of the\nyears of the kings age. Storms during a year of\nFor campaign purposes, the calendar starts on High\nSun (the first day of the year) of the Year of Priests\nDefiance, in the 170th Kings Age. The next Year\nof the Messenger will be the Year of Enemys Slumber, six years away.\nEvery 45 years, a brilliant comet visits Athas. By\nnight one can read by the messengers light, and it\ncan be seen clearly in the full light of day. Folklore\nholds that the messenger visits the dragon every 45\nyears to deliver to him important information\nreconnaissance that the stars have observed since its\nlast visit.\nDays are kept track of in a variety of ways. Merchants tend to identify days with phrases such as\nthirty five days past the high sun. Other schemes\ndivide the year into 25 weeks of 15 days each, the\nnames of those days associated with important personages of a particular royal house. In DARK SUN\ncampaigns, DMs may stick to seven day weeks with\nthe standard Gregorian calendar names for simplicity.\nEach year is made up of exactly 375 days: the exact time between highest suns. Athasians have no\nseasons that govern their thinking of time-there is\nno marked difference in temperature or weather\npatterns. However, the year is divided into three\nequal phases: high sun, sun descending, and sun\nascending. Highest sun is the first day of the year in\nthe calendar of Tyr and lowest sun indicates the\nmidpoint of the year (which, incidentally, occurs at\nmidnight, and is generally observed in nighttime\nceremonies).\nWinds Vengeance are believed to be more powerful\nand dangerous, so many overland trips are avoided.\nSacrifices and prayers are called for to ward off the\ngreat beast during years of Dragons Agitation.\nYears of Enemys Contemplation are supposed to\nenliven treaties and alliances-the list goes on.\nThe  Endlean Cycle\nThe Seofean Cycle\nStarting the Campaign\n8 5</p>\n<p>Dehydration\nSubstituting Other Liquids\nAs PCs adventure, one overriding consideration\nwill almost certainly be the supply of water. Quite\noften in DARK SUN campaigns, characters will\nbe in situations where the supply of water has no\nimpact on the adventure. These dehydration rules\nare intended for extreme situations only and should\nonly be enforced when a lack of water could be lifethreatening.\nEffects of Dehydration\nHow much water a character needs depends upon\nhis level of activity and his race. An active character\n(hard exertion, walking, riding, etc.) needs 1 gallon\nof water per day. An inactive character (sitting, resting, or sleeping, etc.), needs ½ gallon of water per\nday.\nDehydration Effects Table\nIf the character is in the shade during the entire\nday, he only needs half the amount of water dictated\nAmount of Water\nConstitution Loss\nby his activity. A character wearing a full suit of\nmetal armor requires twice as much water each day\nto avoid dehydration. Thus, a character in metal armor who undertakes only light activity but is unable\nto remain in shaded areas would require 1 gallon of\nwater.\nA character who does not drink enough water will\nsuffer the effects of dehydration.\nThri-kreen and half-giants suffer from dehydration differently than humans and normal demihumans.\nThri-kreen: Thri-kreen can go for one week on\nthe amount of water it takes to sustain a human for\none day. Thus, thri-kreen characters only roll for dehydration once per week without water.\nHalf-giants: Due to their great size, half-giants\nneed four gallons of water per day when active or\ntwo gallons when inactive.\nA character can rehydrate by drinking his full allotment of water through the course of one day. At the\nend of that day, his Constitution score goes back up\n1d8 points. Each consecutive day that the characters\nwater needs are met restores another 1d8 points until\nConstitution losses are cumulative over consecutive\ndays of dehydration; a characters hit point adjustment, system shock, resurrection survival, poison save,\nand regeneration rate all drop accordingly. Every\npoint drop in the characters hit point adjustment\n(from +1 down to 0, or from -1 down to -2, etc.)\nwill reduce the characters hit points by a number\nequal to the characters level (highest level for dual-or\nmulti-classed characters). A character whose constitution reaches 0 is deadsuch characters have a resurrection survival number of 25%.\nFull requirement\nNone\nHalf or more of requirement\n1d4\nLess than half of requirement\n1d6\nA lack of water is reflected in the game by a reduction in Constitution. Beginning with the first\nday a character does not receive his required allotment of water, consult the dehydration table at midnight and immediately apply the result.\nMany common beverages such as wine, beer, ale,\nand fruit juices can supplement a characters water\nintake-the quantities per day remain the same. In\ntimes of desperation, players may suggest more outlandish liquids to stave off dehydration: honey, tree\nsap, even the blood of fallen monsters. Generally,\nnone of these are suitable substitutes.\nWater Consumption\nUnusual Races\nRehydration\n8 6</p>\n<p>the character is fully recovered. Lost hit points are regained at a characters normal recovery rate.\nExample of Dehydration\nThyasius, a human third son of a noble family, is\ncaptured by elven nomads. When his family fails to\nMovement by Night\npay the ransom, the elves turn him loose in the desert\nwithout food or water. His Constitution score is 15.\nAfter the first day without any water, he rolls a 3 on\n1d6 bringing his Constitution temporarily down to\n12. Since Thyasius is a 5th-level fighter, five of his hit\npoints were due to his original Constitution of 15, so\nthese are temporarily lost, as well. After a second day\nwithout water, Thyasius rolls 6 on 1d6, bringing his\nConstitution down to 6. Since the hit point adjustment for a character with a Constitution score of 6 is\n-1, he will temporarily lose another five hit points.\nAfter the third day, he rolls a 1, bringing his Constitution down to 5. Since the hit point modifier is still 1, Thyasius loses no more hit points on the third day.\nOn the fourth day, he is found by a half-elven trader\nwho gives him a full gallon of waterThyasius rolls\n1d8 and regains 6 of his lost Constitution points. His\nlost hit points will return more slowly, in accordance\nOverland Movement\nwith his normal healing rate.\nWater must be carried in skins or barrels. The\nwines insisted in the Equipment Lists carries one\ngallon of liquid. The small barrel listed carries 30\ngallons. Every gall on of water (with its container)\nweighs 3 pounds.\nR a c e\nAnimals also suffer dehydration. Tiny animals\nneed I/8 gallon; small animals need ½ gallon; mansized animals need 1 gallon; larger than man-sized\nanimals need 4 gallons; huge animals need 8 gallons; gargantuan animals need 16 gallons of water\nper day. Animal water intake can be cut by half for\nshade or inactivity, or quartered for both.\nHuman\n24\nDwarf\n12\nE l f\n24\nHalf-elf\n24\nHalf-giant\n30\nHalfling\n12\nM u l * *\n2 4\nThri-kreen***\n36\n30\n15\n30\n30\n37\n15\n3 0\n45\nThe races of Dark Sun also have different movement rates than those in traditional AD&D® campaigns. The following table details these differences.\nThe rules presented for overland travel in the Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide still\ngovern movement on Athas. It is important to note,\nhowever, that those suffering from dehydration cannot undertake a forced march.\nThe draw back to such plans is that good rest under the blistering sun of the day is difficult. Characters who are travelling by night must seek shelter\nduring their daytime rest periods. Rock outcroppings or caves will suffice, as will tents or other\nmake-shift buildings. If such shelter cannot be located, each character must make a save vs. poison\nin order to rest well. Those who fail will sleep fitfully\nand can not memorize spells or recover hit points.\nThri-kreen obviously are not subject to this rule.\nAt night, the temperatures in all types of terrain\ndrop significantly, though moisture is still at a premium. If characters decide to travel by night, they\ngain the benefit of working in shade (half water consumption).\nAt the end of a day that an animal doesnt get its\nfull allotment of water, there is a 10% chance it will\ndie, that chance increasing by 10% for each additional day without water. Animals fully rehydrate after one\nday in which they drink their full allotment of water.\nTransporting Water\nAnimals and Dehydration\nMovement Points\nForce March\n8 7</p>\n<p>* For overland movement, an elf may add his ConM o u n t\nMovement Points\nstitution score to 24 (his normal movement rate)\nor 30 (his forced march rate) to determine his actual movement in miles (or points) per day.\n** This is for a normal 10-hour marching day. A\nmul can move for 20 hours per day on each of\nthree consecutive days. The fourth day, however,\nmust be one of rest in which the character only\ntravels for 10 hours. A resting mul can still\nforce march.\n*** This is for a normal 10-hour marching day. A\nthri-kreen can always move for 20 hours per day.\nHalf-giants and Thri-kreen\nTerrain Modifiers in Overland Movement\nAthas challenges its characters with a variety of\nnew terrain types, each of which affects movement in\ndifferent ways.

Each kank needs only two gallons of water per\nday to avoid dehydration.\nAll kank mounts are of the food-producer variety,\ncreating large globules of green honey on the abdomen every other day; it can be eaten by all the player\n8 8</p>\n<p>character races and counts as one gallon of water.\nCharacters on a strict diet of kank honey can survive\non it alone for a period of days equal to their Constitution score; after that, the characters diet must be\nsupplemented with other foodstuffs or he will become weakened and ill. A kank that is dehydrated\nUse of Vehicles\nor not getting enough food does not produce honey.\nA kank pushed to double or triple its normal\nmovement rate receives a +1 bonus to its saving\nthrow to avoid exhaustion.\nInix: An inix is a large lizard that can be tamed for\nuse as a beast of burden. Each can carry up to 2,000\npounds of cargo or passengers. Each inix needs 150\npounds of food and eight gallons of water per day. If\nallowed to graze every day in scrub plain, forest, or\nverdant belt terrain, an inix will forage enough food\nfor itself. Every day that an inix doesnt receive its fill\nof water or food, it must save vs. death or go berserk.\nThe animals basic saving throw is 10, but there is a\ncumulative -2 penalty on the save imposed with each\npassing day. The berserk inixs aim is not to eat its\nmasters, but to escape to forage elsewhere. However, it\nwill attack those who try to stop it-once berserk, an\ninix must be either set free, magically or psionically\ncharmed, or killed. The chance to go berserk is in addition to dehydration.\nAn inix can be pushed to double or triple its normal movement, like any other mount.\nMekillot: This is a huge animal that can carry or\npull up to 8,000 pounds on its back or up to 40,000\npounds on a wagon. A mekillot needs 300 pounds\nof food and 16 gallons of water per day.\nWhen in use as a pack animal, a mekillot may\ndecide to stop working or to move in a random direction. Each day, roll 1d20. On a roll of one, the\nmekillot stops where it is and wont move further\nthat day. On a roll of two, the mekillot takes a new\ndirection, not given to it. Exactly when the mekillot\nbecomes stubborn is determined randomly (roll\n1d10 for the ten-hour march day). A stubborn mekillot can sometimes be controlled through magic or\npsionics. Any physical effort to change a mekillots\nmind (a beating, attempting to lure it with food,\netc.) enrages it and causes it to attack.\nA mekillot cannot be pushed to double or triple\nits normal movement.\nWagons, carts, and similar conveyances must be\npulled by kanks, mekillots, or the like. A cart is any an\nwagon of less than 1,000 pounds capacity; carts\ngenerally have two wheels and can be drawn by one\nkank. Open, enclosed, and armored caravan wagons that require multiple draft animals also require\na teamster to drive them-a teamster is any character with the animal handling proficiency.\nWagons can be easily broken, especially when in\ndifficult terrain. For every day of travel, a wagon has\na 1% chance of breaking down (broken axle or\nwheel, the floor gives way, etc.). For every day of\ntravel in rocky badlands, stony barrens, or mountain terrain, there is a 3% chance of breaking down.\nThese chances are not cumulative with the passage\nof time. Broken wagons can be repaired by someone\nwith the carpentry or engineering proficiency.\nA wagon moves at the speed of its beasts of burden. The animals cannot be pushed to double or\ntriple their normal speed while pulling a wagon.\nChariots are just as described in the DMG, except that on Athas they are pulled by kanks. Kank\nteams of one, two, or four may be used that carry\nchariots holding no more than one, two, or three\nwarriors, respectively. Chariots are more fragile and\ntend to break down during times of high speed and\nstress (such as combat). Use the wagon break down\nrates for day to day movement. However, in combat\nthese same percentage chances apply per round,\nand are doubled if the chariot is turned more than\n45 degrees while at high speeds.\nHowdahs are are small structures built for the\nbacks of mekillots and inix. Having a howdah does\nnot reduce the animals carrying capacity, and it\ncan still move at double or triple rate, subject to the\nlameness and exhaustion rules in the DMG.\n8 9</p>"}, "title": {"show": false}, "image": {"displayMode": 0}, "sort": 10000}], "sort": 10000}

The sorcerer-kings use the\ngames to entertain their slave and noble populations\nand to hold barbaric executions and trials by combat. On Athas, life is cheap and the champions of\nthe arenas are the popular folk-heroes of the age.\nPlayer characters may well find themselves thrust\ninto the arena as prisoners or gladiators. Success\ncan mean great things; failure means certain death.\nMore powerful player characters may become\nchampions or may themselves own entire stables of\ngladiators.\nThe customs of every arena are unique, but some\ngeneralities can be drawn about the various matches\nmade and the treatment of slaves bound for the arena floor\nGames: All arenas feature spectacles that pit\ngladiatorial slaves against each other or against ferocious beasts. Wagering on these games is the sport\nof sorcerer-kings, nobles, merchants, and peasants\nalike.\nMatinee: Matinees feature very simple combats,\npitting inexperienced gladiators or prisoners against\neach other in struggles to the death. Matinee warriors are never well armed or armored. Combatants\nwho do well in matinee games sometimes rise to\nhigher contests or are traded from house to house.\nAt times, the sorcerer-king, master of the games,\nuses matinees for simple executions, as well. Matinees whet the spectators appetites for more skilled\ngames to come.\nGrudge Match: Gladiators who have met before\nand survived are often called upon to fight again.\nWagering on grudge matches is especially heavy.\nMost often, grudge matches arent fought to the\ndeath, only to severe injury; thus the combatants\nmay fight again.\nTrial by Combat: Many people accused of crimes\nby the sorcerer-king or his templars receive the right\nto trial by combat. Unfortunately for the accused,\nthe sorcerer-king chooses whom the accused will\nfight, picking from among his best gladiators.\nDeath is tantamount to a confession of guilt. Those\nwho win gain their freedom, but are often accused\nand imprisoned again unless they flee the city.\nMatched Pairs: Many stables present pairs of\ngladiators to fight side-by-side. Pairs are trained together and selected to complement each others\nskills.\nBestial Combat: Gladiators and prisoners are often sent into the arena against savage beasts. The\nsorcerer-kings sponsor expeditions to capture wild\nanimals, or buy them from the many caravans that\ncome to their cities. The crowd finds these bloody\naffairs particularly enjoyable.\nTest of Champions: A test of a champion is often\nthe culmination of a days gladiatorial games. A\npopular and powerful gladiator is selected to face a\nseries of unusual tests. They may be as simple as\nfighting several demihuman or animal opponents at\nonce or more elaborate contests against magical or\npsionic opponents in a maze of walls assembled just\nfor the occasion.\nAdvanced Games: Most cities have team games\nthat are popular with their audiences, but make no\nsense to those from outside the city. The rules are\ncomplicated and deadly, involving dozens of gladiators at a time.\nStables: Most noble and merchant houses have\nstables of slaves. These slaves combat each other as\nwell as the gladiators, criminals, wild animals, and\nintelligent animals sponsored by the sorcerer-king,\nhimself.\nTypical stables of slaves have between 10 and 100\npotential arena combatants. The sponsoring noble\nhouse provides the slaves with adequate food, cloth68</p>\n<p>and the amount of wagering on each side. The rich\ning, and housingnobles want their investments to\npay off, so gladiatorial slaves seldom want for the\nnecessities of life. The slaves are trained for 12\nhours virtually every day in the courtyards of the nobles estate, overseen by armed guards and their instructors.\nEvery slave in a stable receives minimal training in\narmed and unarmed combat before being sent to\nhis first matches. Those who show promise (and\nwho survive the dangerous early days of their careers) are further trained in specialized combat techniques. This training emphasizes skilled unarmed\ncombat, raw endurance, and specialization in arena\nweapons such as the trident, quabone, and net.\nSlaves who have survived several matches and undergone this more extensive training are considered\ngladiators (levels 1 through 4, usually) and are the\nmainstay of the stables arena warriors.\nEvery stable has its champion or champions. A\nchampion is a gladiator of level 5 through 20, the\nmost experienced warrior in the stable. When a single arena hosts multiple high-level gladiators, rivalr i e s  c a n  d e v e l o p .  U s u a l l y ,  r i v a l r i e s  b e t w e e n\nchampions within a single stable are not allowedone stable will not arrange a match between two of\nits own, no matter how fierce the rivalry. The champion of a stable has performed well in all the\nmatches described above and has gained the attention of every other noble house.\nWagering: Bets between spectators run rampant\nduring the games. Noble houses and the sorcererking himself cover all wagers against their own gladiators, setting odds based on the gladiators involved\nvery often challenge each other with enormous bets,\nhoping to wipe out another noble house with the\noutcome of a single contest.\nWhen player characters want to wager on gladiatorial games, the DM may handle it in one of two\nways. If all players agree, they can roll up the gladiators in question and play the match out themselves.\nOtherwise, the DM must determine the outcome\nrandomly. The odds on any particular contest will\n69</p>\n<p>vary, but a player character can rarely do more than\nTurning and Controlling Undead\ndouble or triple his original bet.\nTrading of Gladiators: Gladiators are often traded or sold to other houses. Of course, subterfuge\nand intrigue run wild in the gladiatorial pits. A bard\nmay be sent to one house just to poison and weaken\nthat houses champion in advance of an offer to\npurchase him. Also, it is unwise to refuse the\nsorcerer-kings request to purchase a gladiator, no\nmatter how little he offers.\nBattling Undead in Dark Sun\nOn Athas, undead are still just that: dead beings\nthat are somehow animated to function among the\nliving. In the DARK SUN campaign world, undead come in two varieties: mindless and free-willed.\nMindless undead are corpses or skeletal remains\nanimated by some character or creature for its own\npurposes. When encountered, skeletons and zombies are always mindless, controlled by their animators. Skeletons and zombies are never free-willed.\nUndead monsters created using an animate dead\nspell are always mindless.\nFree-willed undead are usually very powerful creatures with great intellect and ambition. Every freew i l l e d  u n d e a d  c r e a t u r e  i n  D a r k  S u n  i s\nunique-each has its own reason for existing and its\nown set of strengths and weaknesses. Athas has no\nghouls, shadows, wights, ghasts, wraiths, mummies,\nspectres, vampires, ghosts, or liches, though PCs\nmay encounter a host of monsters very much like\nthem. Confronting and defeating a free-willed undead creature in Dark Sun is always interesting and\nchallenging-powerful undead on Athas break all\nthe familiar molds.\nCharacter Death\nQuite often, free-willed undead have minions, either living creatures or mindless undead that they\nhave animated. Oftentimes Athas powerful undead operate undiscovered among the living, while\nsome have even become powerful allies of the\nsorcerer-kings, themselves.\nAthasian clerics draw their spell casting powers\nfrom the elemental planes of earth, air, fire, and water. They also can tap the Positive Material plane\nfor augury, other information, and the ability to\nturn undead creatures. Templars draw their magical\npowers through their sorcerer-kings, who in turn\ndraw upon the Negative Material plane; templars\ncannot turn undead, but they can control them.\nDruids have no powers over undead.\nTurning Undead: A cleric on Athas wishing to turn\nundead must challenge the creature with the power of\nhis elemental plane. A cleric of earth, for instance,\nmust throw dirt or dust toward the undead, but he\nneed not strike them, so no attack roll is needed. A\ncleric of water must splash water at the undead, and a\ncleric of fire must toss ash or hold forth a burning\nobject. One of the great advantages granted a cleric of\nair is that he can turn undead, with a breath. Once\nthe character has made the challenge, he rolls for\nturning the undead normally. Free-willed undead are\nturned according to their relative power, which is measured by their Hit Dice only.\nTurned undead flee as described in the Players\nHandbook. Dispelled undead are spectacularly\novercome by the element: suffocated by earth,\ncharred and burnt by fire, dissolved by water, or\nbattered by hurricaneforce winds. These elemental\ncatastrophes only effect the undead being dispelled.\nCommanding Undead: Templars, wizards using\nnecromancy, and sorcerer-kings can command undead as per the rules for Evil Priests and Undead in\nthe Players Handbook.\nDark Sun is a particularly dangerous place; one\nwhere character death is frequent and, at times,\ngruesome. High PC mortality rates find some relief\nin the character treea fallen player character is\nimmediately replaced by another of similar level, a\ncharacter with which the player is already familiar.\n7 0</p>\n<p>Waging Wars\nHovering on Deaths Door\n(Optional Rule)\narmies.\nStill, as deadly a world as Athas is, player characters, especially those at low levels, may die too frequently. Thus, in the DARK SUN  campaign,\nDMs should use the Hovering on Deaths Door\noptional rule (the so-called neg 10 rule), presented below.\nstill wiped from his memory, however. (Even this\npowerful spell does not negate the shock of the experience.)\nD M s  m a y  f i n d  t h a t  t h e i r  D A R K  S U N  c a m paign has become too deadly: too many player characters are dying. If this happens, you may want to\nallow characters to survive for short periods of time\neven after their hit points reach or drop below 0.\nWith this rule, a character can remain alive until\nhis hit points reach -10. As soon as the character\nreaches 0 hit points, though, he falls to the ground\nunconscious.\nThereafter, he automatically loses 1 hit point each\nround. His survival from this point on depends on\nthe quick thinking of his companions. If they reach\nthe character before his hit points reach -10 and\nthen spend at least one round tending his wounds\n(e.g., stanching the flow of blood), the character\ndoes not die immediately.\nIf the only action is to bind his wounds, the injured\ncharacter no longer loses 1 hit point each round, but\nneither does he gain any. He remains unconscious\nand vulnerable to damage from further attacks.\nIf a cure spell of some type is cast upon him, the\ncharacter is immediately restored to 1 hit point-no\nmore. Further cures do the character no good until\nhe has had at least one day of rest. Until such time,\nhe is weak and feeble unable to fight and barely\nable to move. He must stop and rest often, cant\ncast spells (the shock of near death has wiped them\nfrom his mind), and is generally confused and feverish. He is able only to move and hold somewhat disjointed conversations.\nIf a heal spell is cast on the character, his hit\npoints are restored as per the spell, and he has full\nvitality and wits. Any spells he may have known are\nA warriors followers almost never arrive with all\nof their equipment.

Obviously a warrior will\nThough fighters and gladiators automatically\ngain followers when they reach higher levels, any\ncharacter, regardless of class or race, may find himself at the head of a rag-tag army of followers. The\npolitical fortunes of Dark Sun characters can rise\nand fall rapidly: military might keeps powerful\nforces at bay and gives a character the strength to\naffect large populations and areas of Athas.\nOnce player characters must deal with large numbers of troops, waging wars of defense or expansion in\nthe DARK SUN campaign world, the DM should\ninstitute BATTLESYSTEM  miniatures rules to\nfight these wars. Adopting BATTLESYSTEM removes the outcomes of important battles from the\nhands of the Dungeon Master and puts them on the\ntabletop where they belong.\nPlayer characters will eventually be called upon to\nfight wars, either as soldiers or as commanders of\nThe sands of Athas have been stained red with\nthe blood of a thousand campaigns of conquest.\nWars are waged over food, water, territory, and less:\nsorcerer-kings pit armies of slaves against each other, watching with cold-hearted pleasure as hundreds\nmeet their deaths, more often than not all over some\nwager or just for the enjoyment of the spectacle.\nAthas is a violent world where the hand of diplomacy bears a sword or chatkcha.\nFollowers\n7 I</p>\n<p>want to arm and armor his followers, and see to it\nthat they are well fed and housed in order to keep\nthem in premium fighting condition, but circumstances and finances sometimes leave little choice.\nDark Sun characters seldom (if ever) wear complete suits of metal armor. The reasons are manifold, but focus primarily on the oppressive heat of\nthe Athasian sun and the scarcity of metal. It is not\nuncommon, at least among heroic sorts, for a character to wear scavenged portions of armor, however.\nDetermining the correct Armor Class for someone in piecemeal armor can thus be very important.\nEach type of armor piece has a specific AC modifier\nassociated with it. When a piece of armor is worn,\nthat modifier is subtracted from the characters base\nArmor Class (usually 10) to determine his actual\nAC.

A character with armor over more than two\nlimbs or wearing a breastplate is subject to the full\neffects of the Dark Suns savage heat.\nAlthough piecemeal armor is lighter than full\nsuits of armor, it can still be quite heavy and cumbersome. Breastplates weigh one half the weight of a\ncomplete suit of that armor type and each arm or leg\npiece weighs one eighth the weight of the original\nsuit.\nNo more than one piece of armor may be worn to\nprotect a specific region of the body. Thus, it would\nbe impossible for a character to wear two breastplates and claim a double bonus to his Armor\nClass.

Before long,\nhis blood is thick and gummy. His heart must work\nhard to circulate it. Finally his system overheats, leaving him dead and alone in the sands.\nThe wind does little to help matters. As hot as a\nAs far I as can tell, all parts of Athas share the\nblazing sun, the dangerous winds, and the lack of\nwater. Nothing I have seen in my own explorations\nor heard from the hundreds of travelers I have interviewed points to any other conclusion. Athas is an\nendless wasteland, spotted by tiny oases of fecundity, inhabited by brutal predators. It is, for all intents\nand purposes, a land of mortal desolation.\nAt night, the low humidity has the opposite effect.\nThe days heat escapes into the sky, plunging the\ntemperature to 40 degrees or less-and in the mountains, even to zero.\nI have already noted what the lack of water can\nmean to a thirsty man, but the dry climate affects\nAthas in other ways. It allows the sun to shine down\nunreflected on the barren ground, which is why it\ngrows so hot during the day.\nThis is my home, Athas. It is an arid and bleak\nplace, a wasteland with a handful of austere cities\nclinging precariously to a few scattered oases. It is a\nbrutal and savage land, beset by political strife and\nmonstrous abominations, where life is grim and\nshort.\nferal elves sweep out of the salt plains to plunder\nlonely caravans, mysterious singing winds call men\nto slow suffocation in a Sea of Silt, and legions of\nslaves clash over a few bushels of moldering grain.\nThe dragon despoils entire cities, while selfish kings\nsquander their armies raising gaudy palaces and\ngarish tombs.\nAs dangerous as it is, the wind is merely an inconvenience when compared to the greatest danger of\nAthasthe lack of water. In most places, it rains no\nmore than once a year. In some places it only rains\nonce in ten years, and the only available water lies in\nbrackish, mineral-crusted oasis ponds. Aside from\na handful of streams that trickle less than fifty miles\nbefore drying up, there is not a single river on the\nplanet-though I have crossed plenty of ancient\nbridges and know that rivers were once common.\nWhat the world was like in those days, I cannot\nimagine.\nBreezes on Athas are suffocating and dust-laden,\ncaking everything they touch with yellow-orange silt,\nspoiling food, and filling a mans eyes with pasty\nmud. Even still days are perilous. Columns of superheated air can rush upward in terrific whirlwinds, carrying dust, plants, and men to great\nheights-then suddenly dying away and leaving\ntheir reluctant passengers to fall to a horrible death.\nI live in a world of fire and sand. The crimson sun\nscorches the life from anything that crawls or flies,\nand storms of sand scour the foliage from the barren\nground. Lightning strikes from the cloudless sky,\nand peals of thunder roll unexplained across the\nvast tablelands. Even the wind, dry and searing as a\nkiln, can kill a man with thirst.\nThis is a land of blood and dust, where tribes of\nforges breath, it blows up sandstorms that last 50\ndays at a stretch, speeding the evaporation of water\nfrom skin and soil alike.

There are many omissions, and no doubt\ndozens of errors, for my information is gathered\nfrom travelers, merchants, and explorers-some of\nwhom no doubt felt that it was in their best interest\nto mislead me wherever possible.\nNevertheless, certain broad outlines do emerge.\nAthas, or at least the explored portion, consists of\nabout one million square miles of desert. In its center, covering an area of about 120,000 square miles,\nis a vast, dust-filled basin that I call the Sea of Silt.\nBecause of travel difficulties to be discussed later,\nthe Sea of Silt remains almost entirely unexplored.\nSurrounding this dry sea is a band of Tablelands,\nranging from as much as 400 miles wide to as little\nas 50. The Tablelands consist of many types of terrain: golden dunes, stony barrens, dust sinks, white\nsalt flats, rocky badlands, and plains of yellow-green\nscrub-brush.\nThough the picture I have painted so far is of a\nstark and rugged land, I do not mean to say that\nAthas is dreary or monotonous. To the contrary, it\nhas a majestic and stark beauty. When first light\ncasts its emerald hues over the Sea of Silt, or when\nsunset spreads its bloody stain over the Ringing\nMountains, there is a certain feral beauty that stirs\nthe untamed heart in all of us. It is a call to take up\nspear and net, to flee the city, to go and see what\nlurks out in the barrenness.\n3</p>\n<p>these oases are the disorderly jumbles of buildings\nand people that we know as cities. Though each city\nreflects the personality of the king that rules it, all\nare precariously balanced at the edge of starvation,\nbarely scratching enough food from their small plots\nof land to support their populations.\nstrangers out. In the center of every city, a powerful\nsorcerer-king lives inside a secure fortress, ruling his\nsubjects through a sophisticated hierarchy of bureaucrats, nobles, and rapacious clergymen. Each\ncity is a state unto itself, its king wielding absolute\nauthority over every living thing inside its walls and\ncrawling through its fields.\nThe Tablelands are encircled by the various ranges of the Ringing Mountains. These ranges all run\nnorth and south. To the east and west of the Sea of\nSilt, the mountains form solid walls separating the\ntablelands from the unknown regions beyond. To\nthe north and south of the dusty sea, they form a\nseries of parallel ribs. The deep valleys between the\nridges lead away from central Athas like a series of\nlong (and hazardous) corridors.\nVillages are no more than clusters of mud-brick\nshelters erected at minor oases in various forlorn\nplaces, such as the edge of a salt flat or in the shelter\nof a rocky overhang. Depending on their nature,\nthey are ruled by officious bureaucrats, minor despots, or, occasionally, even democratic councils. At\nbest, they are semipermanent. Sooner or later, the\ndragon comes calling, the oasis dries up, or a tribe\nof raiders sweeps out of the wastes. Within a few\nyears of such an event, all traces of the village are\nburied beneath a massive sand dune or carried away\nby the howling wind.\nIn every direction, beyond the mountains lie the\nHinterlands. We have- little knowledge of what\nabides there. Many men have set out to explore the\ndepths of this unknown region, but I have never met\none who returned. During the one journey that I\nundertook to view just the edge of the Hinterland,\nan invisible braxat carried off my companions, a\ntribe of halflings tried to eat me, and a silk wyrm\nhounded my trail for over a week. It is a wonder that\nI returned at all.\nThe dynastic merchant houses are sophisticated\ntrading companies with networks extending many\nhundreds of miles, transcending political boundaries, and spanning all social classes. Their trading\nposts are found on bleak peninsulas jutting into the\nSea of Silt, or in box canyons located high in the\nRinging Mountains. A sporadic stream of cargo\nruns from these outposts to the cities, carrying the\ngoods with which the houses stock their vast bargaining emporiums. Each house may have facilities\nin a number of cities. Most are owned by single families and passed on from generation to generation.\nNomadic herdsmen wander the scrub plains,\nAthasian Culture\nAlthough Athas is a wasteland, it is not an empty\nwasteland. The world is fairly crawling with humans, demihumans, and humanoids. Every group\nhas found a different way to survive in this barren\nand harsh environment. In general, I have found\nthat all cultures seem to fall into one of seven basic\ncategories. There are city dwellers, villagers, merchant caravan dynasties, herdsmen, raiders,\nhunter-gatherers, and hermits.\nstony barrens, and sand dunes, pausing for a week\nor two wherever there is pasture enough for their\nflocks to graze. Their bands are usually small, consisting of five to ten extended families (50-150 individuals), for their harsh way of life will not support\nlarge populations. Most herdsman have fiercely independent spirits, governing themselves through a\ncouncil of elders. Usually, a magic wielding patriarch serves as the leader of this council.\nThe cities, surrounded by golden fields of crops,\nstand at sizable oases. They are bustling enclaves of\nhumanity, stinking of garbage and ringing with the\nsupplications of beggars. Their tawny towers of fired\nbrick rise from behind thick stone ramparts designed to lock residents inside as well as keep\nWherever something is worth steeling, there are\n4</p>\n<p>Another group of people call themselves the\ndruids and, at least by most accounts, are considered to be clerics. Druids are special in that they do\nnot pay tribute to any single elemental force, but\nOn Athas, there are several different types of\nclerics. Each of them pays homage to one of the four\nelemental forcesair, earth, fire, or water. Of\ncourse, the latter are perhaps the most influental on\nour thirsty world, but all are powerful and worthy of\nrespect.\nTo one extent or another, every human and demihuman on Athas has psionic powers. Most people\nare wild talents, with only one power that they have\nlearned to use by trial and error. But anyone can harness their psionic powers through careful practice\nand study, and every city has at least one training hall\ndedicated to teaching the way of the mind. Many\nwarriors, templars, and sorcerers have attended these\nacademies and developed powerful psionic abilities in\naddition to their normal talents.\nClerical Magic\nPsionics\nThe world is full of powers beyond those that\ncommon men can master. As a rule, they are\ngrouped into three categories: clerical magic, wizardry, and psionics. Each plays an important part in\nthe cycle of life and death on Athas.\nSupernatural Forces\nFor others, however, the long-term drain on Athas\necology is meaningless. They care little for the life\nforce that is lost when they spin their webs of magic.\nThe dark souls, called Defilers, drain the power for\ntheir spells from the world around them. Plants near\nthem whither and once fertile soil turns to sterile ash\nunder their macabre power. Most of Athas sorcererkings are Defilers of the highest power.\nHermits have withdrawn from a society, either by\nchoice or through coercion. They are peculiar individuals who reside at isolated oases and scratch out\na meager living, either by subsistence farming or\nthrough limited hunting. Hermits live in all parts of\nAthas, though you wont meet many because they\navoid contact with most strangers.\nThe primitive hunting and gathering clans have the\nmost versatile cultures. Youll encounter them anywhere: hunting snakes in the salt flats, gathering roots\nin the stony barrens, even stealing eggs from nests\nperched high atop mountainous crags. They live in\nsmall groups of three or four immediate families, usually numbering no more than twenty individuals.\nThe magic of wizards is different from that of the\nclerical orders. It converts the energy of life into\nmagical power that the sorcerer shapes into spells. If\nthis is done with respect for the life forces of the\nworld and care is taken to balance the net loss of\nenergy with the net gain of magic, there are no adverse effects. In most cases, wizards take great care\nto guard the vitality of the world when casting their\nspells and working their enchantments.\nWizardry\nraiding tribes. These bands of despicable cutthroats\nlive by pillaging caravans, poaching nomad flocks,\nand plundering helpless villages. They are cowards\nwho make their homes in desolate places protected\nby wide expanses of salt flats or great tracts of rocky\nbadlands. Their warlords are ruthless and tough,\ntaking and holding their positions through violence\nand treachery.\nIn some cities, the sorcerer-king is glorified as if he\nwere some sort of immortal being. In fact, many\nsuch rulers are actually able to bestow spell-casting\nabilities upon the templars who serve them. Are\nthey truly on par with the elemental forces worshipped by clerics? I think not.\nrather work to uphold the dying life force of Athas.\nThey serve nature and the planetary equilibrium.\nMany people consider it a lost cause, but no druid\nwould ever admit that.\n5</p>\n<p>Psionic powers are not magic. The user focuses his\neffort inward rather than outward, drawing upon\nnatural forces that infuse his own being rather than\nthose that imbue the world around him. Thus, the\nwidespread use of such mental abilities does not further enhance the degradation of our battered Athas.\nHistory\nWhat generally passes for the history of Athasis,\nin my opinion, a jumble of folklore and propahas not heard a bards sonorous voice sing the\nmarvels of the world before ours? The lyrics speak of\na land of plenty, with grass on every hill and water in\nevery draw. Fields of barley and whey stretched for\nmiles, and there were so many sheep that the herds\ncould not be counted. Proud forests of oak and maple covered the wild lands, and men were the masters of the beasts.\nThese ballads sing the praises of warriors who\nfought not for food or entertainment, but for honor,\nglory, and lady love. The kings in these songs were\nnoble warriors who fought terrible beasts and waged\nrighteous wars in defense of their subjects. Clearly,\nthey were men who placed the needs of their domains above their own desires and cravings.\nganda. Most people are too concerned with the\nproblems of the present to devote themselves to the\nlessons of the past. The few who have any interest in\nhistory are the flattering lackeys of kings undertaking the project to glorify their sovereign. The resulting chronicles are implausible fables or mutually\nincompatible fabrications, and never should you\ntrust what you hear in them.\nMost Athasians regard these tales as fanciful\nflights, mere diversions from the toil and misery that\nis their life. As far as the individual songs are concerned, their attitude is no doubt correct, for every\nsinger exaggerates the story to heighten the drama.\nIn sum, however, there may be a kernel of truth to\nthe ancient lyrics and ballads.\nStill, we can glean something from these jaded annals. The authors of the kingly histories stumble over\ntheir own words in their efforts to flatter their monThe world abounds with the ruins of these\narchs, but we know from the sheer number of their\nchronicles that most city-states are thousands of years\nold.

It is certain that powerful\nsorcerers live for centuries, and I know of no king\nthat has died in my lifetime, or that of my-father or\nhis father.\nIf you have ever asked yourself even one of these\nquestions, then you feel in your heart what I have\naccepted as true: Athas is a barbaric shadow of\nsome better world. Like men, the elves, dwarves,\nhalflings, and all the demihuman races are but brutal descendants of worthier ancestors. The dragon,\nthe lions, and the other great beasts are horrible\nabominations of their noble progenitors.

Those spells\nthat indicate some contact with a deity instead reflect\ncontact with a powerful being of the elemental\nplanes.\nWizards draw their magical energies from the living things and life-giving elements around them.\nPreservers cast spells in harmony with nature, using\ntheir magic so as to return to the land what they take\nfrom it. Defilers care nothing for such harmony and\ndamage the land with every spell they cast.\nDefilers wield magic with no concern for their dying\nworld: Indeed, defilers are much to blame for Athass\ncurrent state. With each spell they cast, defilers draw\nmagical energy from the life force of plants in the vicinity and channel it to their own selfish ends.\nEven the sorcerer-kings, however, are not the most\ndread users of defiler magic: the great dragons defiler magic is so powerful that it destroys living animals as well. All magic cast by defilers up to 20th\nlevel, including all 1st through 9th level spells, destroys plant life only. Any creatures in the area,\nhowever, suffer great pain.\nCasting Defiler Spells: Spells cast by defilers use\nall the necessary verbal, somatic, and material components. The absence of any of these precludes the\nsuccessful casting of the spell. The range, duration,\ncasting time, area of effect, and saving throws remain unchanged.\nWhen a defiler casts a spell, all vegetation in a\nsphere around him turns to ash. The radius of that\nsphere depends upon two things: the abundance of\nvegetation in the area, and the level of the spell cast.\n59</p>\n<p>Defiler Magical Destruction Table\nTerrain Type\nSpell Level\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n3\nStony Barrens\n10 14 17 20 22 24 26 28 30\nSandy Wastes\n10 14 17 20 22 24 26 28 30\nRocky Badlands\n10 14 17 20 22 24 26 28 30\nSalt Flats\n10 14 17 20 22 24 26 28 30\nBoulder Fields\n10 14 17 20 22 24 26 28 30\nSilt Sea\n10 14 17 20 22 24 26 28 30\nMountains\n10 14 17 20 22 24 26 28 30\nScrub Plains\n3\n4\n4\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\nVerdant Belts\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\nForest\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\nThe number shown is the radius, in yards,\naround the defiler where all vegetation is turned to\nash. The effect is instantaneous with the casting of\nthe spell.\nNote that these numbers adjust for specific situations. For example, in a city, the mud pits might\nhave no more vegetation than the stony barrens,\nwhile the gardens of the sorcerer-king will be equal\nto a teeming forest.\nCasting Multiple Spells from the Same Location:\nIf a defiler casts more than one spell from the same\nlocation, the radius of destroyed vegetation expands\naround him. Consult the Defiler Magical Destruction Table for the highest level spell cast from that\nlocation, then add one yard for every other spell\ncast. (Spells equal to the highest level spell are treated as additional spells).\nFor example, the defiler Grifyan casts a lightning\nbolt, a 3rd-level spell, while in the scrub plains. The\narea of ash around him will be 4 yards. In the next\nround, he casts a magic missile spell, expanding the\nradius of ash by 1 yard, bringing the total of burnt\nearth to 5 yards. In the third round, Grifyan decides\nto unleash an advanced illusion, a 5th-level spell.\nSince this is the highest-level spell cast from this location, the area of ash is recalculated; 5 yards for the\n5th-level spell, plus 1 yard each for the two lower-level\nspells cast, for a total radius of ash of 7 yards.\n60</p>\n<p>Effects on Living Creatures: Though only plants\nare destroyed within the radius, living creatures are\ncaused great pain. Any being in the radius of a defilers magic suffers an immediate initiative modifier\npenalty equal to the level of the defiler spell cast. No\nmatter how high the resulting initiate roll, though,\nthe pain can never keep a character from performing an action during a round. The initiative penalty\nonly postpones when the action occurs.\nAsh: The ash created by defiler magic is black\nand grey, completely devoid of life or life-giving elements. Nothing will grow in an area of ash for one\nyear. The ash itself is very light and usually blows\naway, leaving behind a lifeless, circular scar on the\nground. Even with the ash gone, though, the defilers magic has leeched all life-giving nutrients from\nthe soil, so that an area defiled may take many years\nto recover life, if it ever does.\nA tree of life is a mighty and magical tree, enchanted by a powerful priest or wizard. The magical\nlife forces of trees of life make them virtually eternal.\nThe greatest trees of life are ancient: many solitary\ntrees predate the villages around them and others\nstand in entire groves, a quiet testimony to the great\nwizards of a bygone age. Present-day priests and\nwizards still create new trees to enrich the world or,\nin the case of the defilers, to pervert their powerful\nlife forces to further their destructive, evil ambitions.\nA tree of life is, in essence, a living magical item.\nIt stores and channels energies from all four elemental planes. Thus, though wizards can create a tree of\nlife, only clerics and druids can tap its special\npowers.\nSpecial Powers: Any cleric or druid in contact\nwith a tree of life receives from the tree four spells,\neach of which can be cast once per day. The spells\ngained are heal, augury, divination, and magic font.\nDestroying a Tree of Life: A tree of life has two\ndistinct parts: its physical form and its life force.\nThe stump, branches, roots, or leaves of a tree of\nand its life force regenerate. If the trees physical form\nis damaged or destroyed, it will grow back, to full size.\nThe tree will regrow at a rate of one quarter of its full\nsize per week. A sprout will appear in one day, grown\nto a sapling in one week. It will grow to a young tree in\ntwo week, then to a full-sized adult tree in three. After four week, the tree of life will revert to its true\nform: an ancient and mighty tree. No matter how\nmany times the physical form of the tree is destroyed,\nRegeneration: Both a tree of lifes physical form\nThe life force of a tree of life is completely snuffed\nif it falls below zero levels or hit points. The life force\nwill not regenerate if either of these numbers falls\nbelow zero, in which case both the life force and the\nphysical form of the tree die.\nDefiler magic also affects a trees life force. Every\nlevel of defiler magic cast within 100 yards of a tree\nof life drains one level of life force from the tree.\nThis negates the effect the spell would otherwise\nhave on surrounding vegetation.\nDestroying the trees life force is much more difficult. A tree of life, at any stage of growth (even\nsprout) has 100 hit points (10 levels of 10 hit points\neach) that can only be affected by life-draining magic. The wizard spells vampiric touch, enervation,\ntrap the soul, and energy drain can each drain hit\npoints; death spell, finger of death, limited wish,\nand raze can each snuff out 3 levels of the target\ntree; and a wish slays the tree. The priest spells that\naffect a trees life force are raise dead (and its reverse slay living), restoration (and its reverse, energy\nd r a i n ) ,  a n d  r e s u r r e c t i o n  ( a n d  i t s  r e v e r s e ,\ndestruction). Undead creatures that have an energy\ndrain attack can affect the life force of a tree of life.\nlife make up its physical form, and are not inherently\nmagical. The same things that would destroy a normal\ntree will destroy the physical form of a tree of life (e.g.,\nchopping it down, burning it) with one exception. Neither climate nor terrain effect a tree of life. One will\nflourish in the middle of the desert or on a rocky\nmountain face, regardless of drought, severe weather,\nnatural lightning, earthquakes, and so forth.\nTrees of Life\n6 I</p>\n<p>it will always grow back in four weeks.\nThe life force of a tree of life regenerates one level\n(10 hit points) per hour. It regenerates even if the life\nARMOR TYPE\nforce reaches zero points, but not if it goes below zero.\nd20 Roll\nArmor\nTrees of life in the World of Athas: Though originally created by wizards to combat the destruction of\nnature, trees of life are now heavily exploited by defilers, who use the trees powerful life forces to charge\ntheir defiling spells. Sorcerer-kings often have large\ngardens within their cities, even within their palaces,\nwhere groves of trees of life are tended and maintained. Thus, defilers can exercise evil magic from\ntheir citadels without decimating the cities below-a\ndesperate measure to keep their tiny verdant belts as\nplentiful as possible.\nMETAL ARMOR\ndI00 roll\nA r m o r\nUse of magical items never causes a defiling effect\non the surrounding grounds. However, defilers who\ncreate magical items do cause destruction at the time\nof manufacture.\nPotions and Oils: On Athas, potions are drawn\nfrom the juices of fruits. Rules on how to use these\nfruits appear in Chapter 10: Treasure.\nScrolls: Scrolls found as part of a treasure will always be papyrus and will lack a case of any kind, unless otherwise noted. As such, these delicate scrolls\noften do not survive the combat in which they are won.\nThe spells on a scroll can be either wizard or priest, as\nindicated in the Dungeon Masters Guide, and\nshould be determined using the random spell lists in\nAppendix 1 of this book.\nThe process of setting a spell to a scroll inherently\nstrips the spell of defiler or preserver characteristics.\nThus, spells cast from scrolls do not cause defiler destruction.\nMagic: These items function just as described in the\nDMG. Such items rarely consist of metal, but rather\nare fashioned from the finest alternate materials available.\nSubstitute the following table\ntreasure are metal or have metal components. Nonmetal weapons can be enchanted as well, but magical\nadjustments must still take into account the inherently\npoorer quality of the material used. Weapons are determined as in the DMG. Weapons can have intelligence, and those with intelligence 15 or greater can\nhave a psionic wild talent (25% chance).\nWeapons: All magical weapons found as part of a\nnecessary.\nMagical adjustment to Armor Class is determined\nnormally.

In game terms, all metal items-swords,\narmor, coinsare worth considerably more than on\nother AD&D® worlds such as Lynn or Oerth.\nVirtually all Athasian city states issue coins\nminted in tribute to their sorcerer-kings. Also, some\nin dependent dwarven communities and some\nwealthy merchant families mint their own coins\nwhen the precious metals are available to them.\nThough the currencies vary (a gold coin minted in\nTyr might be a bit heavier than the square gold\ncoins that bear the Ryharian family crest), they all\nfall under the standard exchange rates given in the\nPlayers Handbook. On Athas, 100 cp (ceramic\nMonetary Systems\npieces) = 10 sp = 2 ep = 1 gp = 1/5 pp.\nCeramic Pieces and Bits: The most commonly\nused coin throughout Athas is the ceramic piece\n(cp). Ceramic coins can be manufactured from the\nmost common clay of Athas, then glazed in specific\ncolors and kilned to discourage forgery. The molded\nshape of ceramic pieces allows them to be broken\ninto 10 separate pie-shaped pieces. Each of these\nbits is worth 1/10 of a ceramic piece.\nWhat Things Are Worth\nThe equipment lists in the Players Handbook\nshow not only how much each item costs, but what\neach item is worth in typical AD&D game coinage.\nOn Athas, the relative rarity of metal increases\nthe value of metal items. Coins themselves are worth\nmore, so fewer Athasian coins are needed to purchase things that arent made of metal. However,\nmetal items, because of the scarcity of metal coinage, cost relatively the same number of coins as in\nother worlds. When Dark Sun characters make\npurchases from the equipment lists in the Players\nHandbook, therefore, the following rules apply:\nAll nonmetal items cost one percent of the price\nlisted.\nAll metal items cost the price listed.\nThus, the small canoe (a nonmetal item) costs 3\nsp, but the long sword (a metal item) costs 15 gp.\nIf an item is typically a mixture of metal and nonmetal components and the metal components could\nbe replaced easily, the nonmetal price applies. For\nexample, Athasian chariot makers have found ways\nto avoid using metal parts to make an equally sturdy\nchariot, so the nonmetal price of 5 gp applies.\nAll prices listed in the DARK SUN boxed set or\nin any other DARK SUN module or accessory already compensate for the rarity of metals. Prices listed\nin other AD&D game products are not adjusted-the\nrules of conversion apply for them, as well.\nSocieties on Athas exchange goods and services\nin three ways: coin, barter, and service.\nCoin: Transactions where goods or services are\npurchased with money remain quite common on\nAthas, despite the lack of metals: Athas is metalpoor, not metal-depleted. Coins are a readily accepted means of payment and, considering the\nincreased value of coins, are less bulky to carry\naround.\nBarter: Barter is the exchange of goods for other\ngoods: no coins change hands. By its very nature,\nbarter is an age-old ceremony of negotiation. Characters in Dark Sun can enter either a simple or protracted barter.\nSimple Barter: In simple barter, characters compare the costs of the items to be exchanged and then\nmatch the quantities until they are approximately\neven. For example, Kyuln wishes to exchange his\ncrop of rice for a metal bastard sword. On Athas,\nKyulns rice is worth 2 bits (2/10 cp) per pound, and\nthe metal bastard sword he seeks is worth 25 gp\n(2500 cp). Kyuln would have to trade 12,500\npounds of his rice (his entire harvest) to the weaponsmith in exchange for his new metal bastard sword.\nThe weaponsmith might not be that hungry.\nProtracted Barter: In protracted barter, dice are\nthrown and costs recalculated in three separate\n4 9</p>\n<p>rounds before a final exchange is made. Because of\nits complexity, protracted barter works best for items\nthat cost more than 100 gp. For protracted barter,\nthe Charisma scores of the parties involved (usually\na player character and nonplayer character controlled by the DM) must be known.\nIn the first round of protracted barter, each party\nrolls 2d6 and adds the result to his Charisma score;\nthe higher roll wins the round. The winner has\nProfessional\ntalked down the price of the losers barter item by\n10 percent. If either party decides to end the barter,\nit is finished here. If neither party decides to end the\nbarter, it continues to a second round, and then to a\nthird. Protracted barter can last no more than three\nrounds. Once entered into, a transaction will take\nplaceneither party can back out of a deal once\nprotracted barter has commenced.\nIf Kyuln from the previous example (Charisma\nscore of 13) were to enter into protracted barter with\nthe weaponsmith (Charisma score 7), he might get a\nbetter or worse deal. In the first round, Kyuln rolls 7\n(+13 = 20) and the weapons smith rolls 10 (+7\n= 17); Kyuln wins the round. He has talked the\nweaponsmith down 10 percent, so the metal bastard\nsword in question is now worth 22 gp and 5 sp. Both\nmen wish to continue into a second round. Kyuln\nStarting  Money\nrolls 4 (+13 = 17) and the weapons smith rolls 10\n(+7 = 17); the tie means that neither cost is adjusted. In the third and final round, Kyuln rolls a 10\n(+13 = 23) and the smith rolls a 7 (+7 = 14);\nKyuln wins again. He has talked the weaponsmith\ndown to 20 gp for the metal bastard sword, so must\nonly exchange 10,000 pounds of his rice for it.\nService: The services a character renders-from\nthose of the unskilled laborers to those of the prized\nengineersall have their asking price.\nD a i l y\nW e e k l y\nArcher/artillerist\n1 bit\nl  c p\n4 cp\nCavalry, heavy\n3 bits 2 cp, 5 bits\nl sp\neach character starts the campaign with, based on\nthe characters class group.

The owning player may\nequip inactive characters at any time prior to using\nthem as active characters.\nAll PCs begin the game with a specific amount of\nmoney. The player should use this starting money to\nequip his character; campaign time need not be\nspent to play out these purchases unless the DM\ndeems it important to his adventure.\nThe following table indicates how much money\nWith both barter and service exchanges, the DM\nshould make certain the goods or services exchanged are needed or desired.

The\ntable below indicates the percentage cost and weight\nof weapons, and modifiers to damage and hit probability for the stats in the Players Handbook.\nThe arquebus is unavailable on Athas.\nArmor\nWeapon Materials Table\nMaterial\nCost\nW t .\nDmg*\nHit Prob.**\nmetal\n1 0 0 %\n1 0 0 %\nbone\n3 0 %\n5 0 %\n- 1\n- 1\nstone/obsidian\n5 0 %\n7 5 %\n- 1\n- 2\nwood\n1 0 %\n5 0 %\n- 2\n- 3\n*The damage modifier subtracts from the damage\nnormally done by that weapon, with a minimum of\none point.\n** this does not apply to missile weapons.\nIn the game and in text, such weapons should always be referred to with their material and make:\nwooden broadsword, bone sickle, metal dagger, and\nso forth. As well as adding flavor to battle scenes,\nthis indication helps the DM keep track of what\ntype of weapon is being used.\nNonmetal weapons detract from the wielders hit\nprobability as well, much in the same way a cursed\nweapon does. Note the hit probability reduction on\nthe players record sheet.\nNonmetal weapons can be enchanted. However,\nenchantment is cumulative with the weapons hit\nprobability modifier; in this case a -1 penalty. The\nnet modifier for a bone dagger +2 is actually +1.\nBreaking Weapons: Obsidian, bone, and wooden\nweapons are prone to breaking. Whenever a successful attack inflicts maximum damage, there is a\n1-in-20 chance that the weapon will break, as per\nthe following example:\nBruth is sent to the arena armed with a bone battle axe against three unarmed gith. In his first\nround, Bruth cleaves through the skull of his first\nopponent (makes a successful attack) and brings\nhim down (rolls an 8 on his 1d8 for damage). Unfortunately, the shock of the blow splinters the bone\nof the axe head (Bruths player rolls a 1 on 1d20\nindicating weapon breakage), leaving him weaponless. Bruths career in the arena may be brief.\nAll forms of armor listed in the Players Handbook are available in Dark Sun. They afford the\nsame AC rating described there.\nMetal Armor in Dark Sun: Two facts on Athas\nconspire to limit the use of metal armor: extreme\nheat and the high price of metal. A suit of field plate\narmor costs 2,000 gp on Athas, the equivalent of\n5I</p>\n<p>200,000 gp on other AD&D ® campaign worlds.\nHousehold Provisions\nSimply put, a sorcerer-king can either purchase several suits of field plate or build a substantial addition to his city walls.\nLikewise, the intense heat across Athas barren\nsurface makes metal armor an unpleasant experiTack and Harness\nence, to say the least. In any daytime combat situation, a character wearing metal armor adds one to\nhis THAC0 for every round of combat beyond the\nfirst and will collapse, exhausted from the heat, in a\nnumber of rounds equal to his Constitution score.\nAlternate Materials: Many types of armor can be\nShields: Shields are mostly constructed with layers of leather stretched over a wooden or bone frame\nTransport\nand hardened. Effective shields can also be constructed of chitinous materials scavenged from dead\ninsectoids. Though made of alternate materials,\nshields on Athas come in the typical varieties: bucklers and small, medium, or body shields.\nconstructed without metal on Athas, using more\nreadily available materials.\nLeather Armor: Perhaps the most common type\nof armor used on Athas, leather armor is shaped to\nthe individual wearing it, and then hardened.\nPadded Armor: As described in the Players\nHandbook, this armor is made from heavy cloth\nand batting. Many Athasian warriors prefer padded armor woven from giants hair.\nHide Armor: Hide armor on Athas is usually\nconstructed from mekillot or braxat hide.\nStudded Leather, Ring Mail, Brigandine, and\nScale \nMail \nArmor: \nThese \nvarieties \nof \narmor \nare\nconstructed using pieces of bone or chitin.\nChain, Splint, Banded, Bronze Plate, or Plate\nMail; Field Plate and Full Plate Armor: These\ntypes of armor must be made with metal components, making them both expensive and potentially\ndeadly in the days heat.\nNew Equipment\nThe following equipment is generally available in\npopulated sectors of Athas for the prices shown.\ninix\ninix, war\nmekillot\nmekillot, war\nWagon, open\n1,000 pound capacity\n2,500 pound capacity\n5,000 pound capacity\n10,000 pound capacity\nWagon, enclosed\n1,000 pound capacity\n2,500 pound capacity\n5,000 pound capacity\n10,000 pound capacity\nWagon, armored caravan\nChariot\none kank, one warrior\ntwo kank, two warrior\nfour kank, three warrior\nHowdah\nBarding\nInix, leather\n35 sp\n240 lb\nInix, chitin\n50 sp\n400 lb\nKank, leather\n15 sp\n70 lb\nKank, chitin\n35 sp\n120 lb\nMekillot, leather\n500 sp\n1000 lb\nMekillot, chitin\n750 sp\n1600 lb\nTun of water (250 gal.)\n1 sp\nFire Kit\n2 bits\n10 sp\n25 sp\n50 sp\nl sp\n10 sp\n2 sp\n50 sp\n10 cp\n20 cp\n30 cp\n50 cp\n15 cp\n25 cp\n40 cp\n60 cp\n100 sp\n5 2</p>\n<p>Animals\nEquipment Descriptions\nErdlu\nHousehold Provisions\nInix\nKank\nTrained\nUntrained\nMekillot\n10 cp\n10 sp\n12 sp\n5 sp\n20 sp\nTun of Water: In most Athasian cities, water is\ndrawn from a collective cistern maintained by the\nsorcerer-king and his templars.

The standard fire-starting kit\ntherefore uses a bow and sticks rather than flint and\nsteel.\nBarding: There are two types of barding for the\nvarious beasts of burden on Athas: leather and chitin. Leather barding is made with stiffened leather\npads, often reinforced with bone or chitin, and\njoined together with cloth or soft leather straps.\nLeather barding affords the animal a -1 bonus to\nits AC. Chitin barding is made from plates of insectoid chitin and bone, fastened together with leather\nand cloth. Chitin barding affords the animal an\nAC bonus of -2. The two types of barding cannot\nbe combined.\nChariot: A chariot is a lightly armored vehicle\nc o n s t r u c t e d  o f  w o o d ,  c h i t i n ,  a n d  h a r d e n e d\nleatherm, designed for riding and combat. The\ndriver of the chariot must have either the teamster/\nfreighter secondary skill or the charioteering proficiency. \nThe \nchariot \ndriver \ncan \nattack \nwith\nsingle-handed weapons while the vehicle is moving,\nbut suffers a -4 penalty to all attack rolls. Others\nin the vehicle suffer no penalty to melee attack rolls,\nbut have a -1 penalty to missile attack rolls while\nthe chariot is moving. Those in a chariot have 50%\ncover from the front or sides, 25% cover from the\nflank or rear (consult the Dungeon Masters Guide\nfor the exact effects of cover and concealment on\ncombat). If one of the animals hitched to a multikank chariot dies or is maimed, the chariots speed\nis reduced to I/3 that of normal. The slain beast may\nalso cause the chariot to crash, but the fallen animal\ncan then be cut loose by survivors. Multiple deaths\nin the animal team bring the chariot to a halt.\nHowdah: A howdah is a frame with seats designed to be mounted on the back of an inix or meWagon, armored caravan: An armored caravan\nwagon weighs 5,000 pounds and can carry up to\n35,000 pounds more. The exact design of any particular armored caravan wagon can change from\ntrip to trip. Artisans customize the interior for each\njourney, adding or taking away slave pens, expanding or removing enclosures, and so forth. In general,\nan armored war caravan can carry a cargo of\n15,000 pounds of goods, plus have room for 50 fully\narmed warriors, 25 slaves in transit, and a handful\nsame animal power as similar-capacity open wagons. Items within enclosed wagons are little affected\nby weather. Some merchants and nomads convert\nenclosed wagons into living quarters. Individuals\nriding within enclosed wagons are considered at rest\nand shaded.\nWagons, enclosed: Enclosed wagons require the\na wooden box on four wooden wheels. A 1,000pound-capacity wagon requires a single kank to pull\nit. The 2,500- pound-and 5,000-pound-capacity\nwagons need teams of two and four kanks, respectively. \nThe \n10,000-pound-capacity \nrequires \na \nsingle\nmekillot to move. Inix are not used to pull wagons\nfor the simple reason that their tails get in the way.\nWagons, open: An open wagon is little more than\nAnyone riding in a howdah is considered to be at\nrest and shaded.\nA war howdah is constructed of much sturdier\nmaterials, affording cover to those within. An inix\nwar howdah weighs 150 pounds and can hold four\nfighters. A mekillot war howdah is a more elaborate\naffair, weighing 1,000 pounds. Within the mekillot\nwar howdahs two levels 16 warriors may ride, four\nof which can fight to any one side at a given time.\nSoldiers in a war howdah can choose to have 25%,\n50%, 75%, or 30% cover and concealment (consult\nthe Dungeon Masters Guide for the exact effects of\ncover and concealment on combat).\nkillot. A normal howdah is made of a light wooden\nframe and has one seat for the animals driver. Normal howdahs do not count against the carrying capacity of the animal, but the drivers weight does.\nTack and Harness\nTransportation\n5 4</p>\n<p>of merchants, nobles, or other stately travelers. Soldiers in an armored caravan wagon can choose to\nhave 25%, 50%, 75%, or 30% cover and concealment (consult the Dungeon Masters Guide for the\nexact effects of cover and concealment on combat).\nWhile one mekillot can pull an armored caravan\nwagon, they are usually drawn by a team of two, to\nprevent the death of a mount stranding the wagon.\nAnimals\nErdlu: Erdlus are herd beasts raised by many different cultures on Athas. These large, flightless\nbirds stand up to seven feet tall and weigh around\n200 pounds. Their omnivorous diet allows them to\ngraze nearly anywhere and their hardy nature keeps\nWeapons\nthem alive in harsh terrain. The price of a single\nerdlu can be as much as double that listed or as little\nas half, depending upon availability. Erdlus eggs\nare also edible: one egg can fetch 3 bits.\nInix: An inix is a large lizard animal that grows to\nas much as 16 feet long. Each can carry up to 2000\npounds. Though herbivorous by nature, inix are vicious combatants, attacking with both tail and bite.\nInix trained for riding are also trained not to fight\nwhile mounted, for no rider could manage to keep\nhis seat while an inix thrashed its mighty tail.\nInix can be fitted with a howdah. Half-giants use\nthem as individual mounts. Inix cannot generally\npull wagons because of their lengthy tails.\nKank: Kanks serve as both herd animals and\nbeasts of burden. They are large insectoids, 4 feet\nhigh and 8 feet long, weighing around 400 pounds.\nAs herd animals, kanks are durable and easily tended. Kanks are not raised for their meat, which becomes foul-smelling as soon as they die. Instead,\nthey are raised for honey globules produced on their\nbellies. A single honey globule can bring 4 bits.\nAs riding beasts, kanks provide effective transportation for a single character (except for halfgiants, who use inix for the same purpose). A kank\ncan carry up to 400 pounds. Kanks used as riding\nanimals also require harnesses and saddles. The\ntack and harness prices given in the Players Handbook for horses work well for kanks also.\nKanks can be hitched to wagons individually or in\nteams. A character needs the teamster/freighter\nsecondary skill or the animal handling proficiency to\neffectively operate teams of kanks.\nMekillot: A mekillot is an enormous G-ton lizard,\nused as a beast of burden. Each one can carry 8,000\npounds or pull up to 40,000 pounds behind it. Mekillots are hard to control and sometimes turn on\ntheir handlers.\nA mekillot can be fitted with a pack howdah or a\nwar howdah, carrying several men into combat.\nChatkcha: This thri-kreen throwing weapon is\ncommon among the steppes tribes. It is a crystal\nwedge that can be thrown up to 30 yards and, due to\nits spin and affect upon the air, still return to the\nthrower if it misses the target.\nGythka: This thri-kreen polearm has wicked\nblades at either end. The weapons thick shaft allows it to be used like a quarterstaff against similarly\narmed opponents.\nImpaler: An impaler is a weapon developed for\narena combat. It has a single shaft about 4 feet long\nwith a pair of long pointed blades, splitting to each\nside and forming deadly T The weapon can be\nswung horizontally or vertically, over the head.\nQuabone: This weapon is constructed from four\nidentical shanks of bone, lashed together to form a\nradially symmetrical, sword-length rod. With its\nlightness and crudely sharpened end, the quabone\nis a fairly ineffective weapon. The quabone is used\nin arena situations where combat is intended to\ndraw out for a long period of time.\nWrist Razor: Wrist razors consist of a trio of\nblades that protrude from a heavy arm band.

Such finds will be specially placed by the\nDM. The objects of art table in the DMG is appropriate for determining the price of such items, except that the number ranges represent ceramic piece\nvalue, not gold piece. Items consisting of steel make\na valuable treasure, as well.\nThe nature of magical items found in DARK\nSUN campaigns is discussed in Chapter 7: Magic.\nWhen magical items are found as part of a lair treasure, Table 88: Magical Items (from the DMG) will\nsuffice to determine each items general category.\nSubsequent rolls on the subtables yield a variety of\nspecific items, though the DM may find some have\nnames that are anachronistic to DARK SUN campaigns. For instance, gauntlets of ogre power are\nvery useful on Athas, but Athas holds no ogres.\nThe various items of giant strength have the same\nproblem because DARK SUN campaigns do not\nuse the traditional pantheon of giants.\nIf a Dark Sun DM rolls up a random magical\ntreasure item with an inappropriate name, he\nshould either change the name or, better yet, dont\ngive the players a name for the item at all. This latter solution makes PCs cautious with their newfound magical items, testing them carefully for\npowers that, were they to know the official name,\nthey might recognize from years of play.\nOther magical items in the DMG are anachronistic not in name only. In magical item descriptions, the mention of humanoids not native to Dark\nSun obviously do not apply.\nA final group of items so contradicts the environment of Athas that they either do not exist, or have\nbeen changed.\npotion of dragon control, scroll of protection from\ndragon breath, bag of tricks, bucknards everfull\npurse, decanter of endless water, horseshoes (all),\nstone horse, hammer +3 dwarven thrower, elven\nchain, and any item having to do with aquatic settings or lycanthropes.\nThe following items are changed to fit DARK SUN\n7 4</p>\n<p>campaigns:\n Potion of Giant Control: Affects any giant.\n Potion of Giant Strength: The strength equivalent names do not apply in the Dark Sun campaign, though all the listed benefits are the same.\n Potion of Undead Control: Roll the 1d10 normally; the result is the maximum Hit Dice of the\nundead that the potion can control.\n Rod of Resurrection: Charges required are gladiator 2, templar 2, psionicist 4, half-giant 6, thrikreen 2, and mul 2.\n Boots of Varied Tracks: Substitute Dark Sun animal tracks for those listed.\n Candle of Invocation: Rather than invoking pantheons of gods, these draw upon the spirits of the\nlands or the elemental planes.\n Deck of Illusions: Though many of the creatures\nlisted are not native to Athas, they can still serve\nas illusions.\n Figurines of Wondrous Power: Keep ebony fly\nand golden lion. Characters will find no other figunless otherwise stated in the description.\nurines on Athas.\n Necklace of Prayer Beads: The bead of summons calls a powerful creature from the elemental\nplanes, instead.\nPotions\nOn Athas, potions come in the form of magical\nfruits or berries. The juices of the fruit hold the\nmagical properties of the potion and the fruit must\nbe eaten to release the magical effect. In Dark Sun,\npotions are never found as fluids in a flask or vial.\nAny juicy berry or fruit may be enchanted with a\npotion. Since the juice itself holds the potion, drier\nfruits such as dates cannot be so enchanted. The\ntype of fruit chosen to house the potion has no effect; any fruit can contain any potion.\nAny potion listed on Table 89: Potions and Oils\nin the Dungeon Masters Guide can be enchanted\ninto a fruit. On Athas, these may be referred to as\npotions or fruits, interchangeably (a potion of giant\nstrength is the same as a fruit of giant strength).\nOnce the skin of the fruit is broken, it must be eaten\nwithin one turn or the potions magic is lost.\nWhereas normal fruits may only remain ripe for a\nfew days or weeks before they begin to rot, potion\nfruits have their period of ripeness greatly extended.\nOnce enchanted with a potion, a fruit will remain\nripe for 99 years. After that time, the enchantment\nfades and the fruit will rot normally.\nThe entire fruit must be eaten to gain the effect of\nthe potion. This takes an entire round. Fruits that\nare enchanted with oil-type potions must be crushed\nand the juice allowed to run over the user, which\ntakes two rounds.\nPotion fruits cannot be identified by taste. A detect magic spell will identify a fruit or tree as magical, but only identify or similar magic provides a\npositive identification.\nPotion fruits can be combined. Different potion\nfruits eaten concurrently will all have their effects on\nthe ingester. Potion fruit duration is 4+1d4 turns\nFruits may be enchanted with potions in one of\ntwo fashions: magical and botanical enchantment.\nMagical Enchantment: Any wizard, cleric, or\ndruid can enchant normal fruits into potions. Magical enchantment occurs as described under Potions in Chapter 10 of the DMG.\nBotanical Enchantment: Any wizard, ranger,\ncleric, or druid can use botanical enchantment. Botanical enchantment is the process of using one enchanted fruit to grow more.\nThe original potion fruit must be planted unused.\nFrom this seed a magical tree grows very quickly,\nproducing a full-sized fruit tree grows in 1d6 weeks.\nOnce the magical tree is grown, a d6 is rolled: on a\nroll of 1 or 2, two new potion fruits of the same type\nappear on the tree; on a 3-5, one new potion fruit of\nthe same type appears on the tree, and on a 6 there\nwill be no potion fruits on the tree. Regardless of\nhow many nonmagical fruits the tree bears, there\nwill be, at most, two potion fruits on it. Once these\nare picked, there will be no additional potion fruits\n75</p>\n<p>from that tree.\nIf a permanency spell is cast on a magical tree, it\ngrows a continuing series of potion fruits. Once the\ntrees potion fruit is picked, a new one grows in 1d6\ndays. Such a tree will live at least 99 years unless it is\ndestroyed.\nBotanical enchantment is somewhat risky. The\ntree must be tended, watered, and pruned every day\nwhile it is growing. Any severe change in the weather, such as a drought or freeze, will ruin the tree and\nno fruit will be borne. Any use of defiler magic near\nthe tree will kill it and render any potion fruits on it\nRing of Life\nuseless. Even if all goes well, the tree may not bear\npotion fruits, anyway.\nThese new magical items can be found as part of\nlair treasures in Dark Sun.

Far from it; over each hill, behind each dune,\nthe terrain is more awesome, more spectacular, more\nbeautiful than what you have already seen. In my\ntravels, I have been overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of this land, cowed by its indifferent brutality,\neven overpowered by the unrestrained might of its\nelements, but never have I been bored.\nIt is beyond my modest capabilities as a geographer to impart all the grandeur and majesty of\nAthas. I can write of storms blowing in from the Sea\nof Silt, of watching a wall of pearly dust billow tenthousand feet into the air, then come roiling ashore\nlike a mountain range crashing down about upon\nyou. I can say that to breathe the steam of the Yellow\nCaves is to lose your wits in a cloud of euphoria, or\ndescribe the queasy feeling of sliding down the\nblack, glassy slopes of the Smoking Crown. I can\nterrify you with stories of being stalked through the\nforest by hungry halflings, and perhaps I can even\nmake your eyes sting by describing what its like to\ncross a salt flat on a windy day. But all you will know\nis what I say of it, and my words could never do\njustice to this magnificent land.\nThere are hundreds of different kinds of terrain\non Athas, from wind-scoured pebble flats to twisted\nbadlands canyons to gleaming sands to jumbled\nboulder fields. Unfortunately, it is impossible to relate in detail the geography of all these places, at\nleast in the number of days remaining to my life.\nInstead, I will describe what Ive learned of the four\ngeneral terrains of Athas: the Sea of Silt, the Tablelands, the Ringing Mountains, and the Hinterlands. Armed with this information, you must see\nAthas for yourself. Perhaps that is as it should be;\neach person must find his own way through the\nsplendorous deserts of our world.\nSea of Silt\nIn the center of the inhabited lands of Athas sits a\nhuge, sunken basin called the Sea of Silt. This reOn stormy days, the wind roars over the sea like\nWhen the wind blows more strongly, as it often\ndoes, the Sea of Silt becomes a boiling cloud of\ndust, the edges tinged with crimson sunlight and the\ncenter as dark as a dragons heart. On such a day, a\nman standing near the sea cannot see more than a\nfew feet in any direction. The dust coats his clothes,\nhis face, the inside of his nose, and even, it seems,\nhis lungs. He cannot see the ground or the sky, and\nwhen he walks his feet drag through inches of thick\ndust. He grows disoriented and lost, and it becomes\nan easy matter for him to wander into the sea itself.\nSometimes, he disappears forever.\nI have met travelers who claim that the Sea of Silt\nwas once a sea of water. As unlikely as this may\nsound, the theory should not be entirely discounted.\nThere are, after all, certain similarities between the\nSea of Silt and a body of water: theyre both flat,\nthey fill low-lying areas, and heavy objects sink in\nthem. Although it does not seem likely that the water itself turned to dust, it is conceivable that this\nbasin was once filled with liquid instead of dust.\nOn a still day, which is so rare as to be almost nonexistent, the Sea of Silt looks like an endless plain of\npearly powder. Sometimes, it lies as flat as a table and\nit seems you can see clear to the other side of the\nworld. More often, the dust has been churned into\nstar-shaped dunes or piled into massive swells. On\nsome days, when the silt lies in parallel, wave-like\nridges, the sea looks like a infinite gray lake, frozen in\nan instant, with the waves all at their peaks.\nUsually, however, the Sea of Silt is not even visible. The slightest breeze stirs up a silvery pall of\ndust that clings to the surface like a fog. It becomes\nimpossible to tell where the silt-laden air ends and\nthe dust-bed beg ins. The sea takes on the aspect of\nan endless moor, the swirling dust rising off the surface like ash-colored stream obscuring your vision\neverything both far and near.\ngion is filled with tiny particles of dust and silt that\nthe wind has carried into this vast depression over\nthousands of years.\n3 9</p>\n<p>the howl of a mekillot. If you are within fifty miles of\nthe Sea of Silt, there is nothing to do but find shelter\nand wait. These are the days when the silt rises\nthousands of feet into the air, blocking out the suns\nlight and turning the day to night. The dust is so\nthick that to breathe without a cloth over the nose\nand mouth is to choke, and to rest in the open for\nmore than a few minutes is to be buried beneath a\ndrift of gray powder.\nThe wind may blow for only a few hours during\nsuch storms, but the silt stays suspended in the air\nlong after it stops. It may take a day or more before\nthe dust settles enough to allow travel again, and\nmore than a week before the haze totally disappears\nfrom the sky.\nEven when the wind is not blowing, however, the\nSea of Silt is far from a hospitable place. The dust is\nso loose that a man cannot walk across it, and it is\ntoo deep for any man to wade through. Anyone who\ntries to do so invariably sinks and is lost. He suffers\na terrible death, suffocating as his lungs fill with\ngray powder.\nAs one might imagine, the difficulties of travel\nhave had a dampening effect on explorations in the\nSea of Siltthough there are those who have tried\nit, of course. I am not one of those fools, however, so\nI must admit that what little I have learned of this\nregion, beyond my own experiences on the shores,\ncomes from second-and third-hand accounts. There\nmay well be errors in what follows, so be forewarned\nthat I take no responsibility for any of the advice\nabout traveling in this region.\nMethods of Travel\nSo far as I know, there are only a few ways frequently used to cross the Sea of Silt: flying over it,\nwading through it, or levitating above it. There are\nother means employed from time to time, and certainly new methods of travel will be thought of in the\nfuture, but for now these remain the principle options of silt crossers.\nFlying\nFlying is the least dangerous of these methods, for\nthe traveler avoids the hazards of the sea itself by\nmoving above them. This method also affords the\nluxury of increasing the distance at which one can\nsee hazards, such as approaching storms or flying\npredators. Unfortunately, this option is not available to most humans and demihumans, as they lack\nwings. Also, if your means of flight should fail you,\nthe sands below lie waiting to consume you when\nyou are forced down.\nOf course, it is possible to use magic or psionics to\nfly, but the number of people blessed with these abilities is rather limited. Those who do choose to fly\nover the Sea of Silt would be well advised to make\nsure that they are going to reach their destination\nwith plenty of time to spare. As mentioned above, if\ntheir ability fails while they are over the Sea of Silt:\nthey will fall into the dust and sink like a rock.\nWading\nWading is usually employed only near the shore,\nfor the dust is too deep in most parts of the sea for\nhumans and demihumans to touch the bottom. At\nthe best, it is a slow and tedious process, for the traveler must use a long pole to probe the sea bed ahead\nof him-or risk falling into an unseen hole-and\nmoving through the silt can be quite exhausting.\nWhen someone steps into one of the many pits\nthat dot the floor of the sea, he simply disappears\nunless he is accompanied by friends who have some\nmethod of retrieving him, like a rope tied around his\nwaist. It appears that such unfortunate victims suffocate within four minutes of their disappearance,\nfor I have heard numerous accounts of searchers\nfinding their companion dead within five or six minutes of his vanishing beneath the surface.\nIt should also be noted that the greater the size of\nthe creature, the farther into the Sea of Silt he can\nwade. I am thinking, of course, of the giants\nparticularly those who make their homes on the is4 0</p>\n<p>lands in the Estuary of the Forked Tongue. They\nhave worked out paths that allow them to wade to\nand from all the islands in that area, much to the\nconsternation of the nobles whose crop lands they\nI have spoken at length with several giants about\nthe nature of their paths. As far as I can tell, it appears that at a depth of fifteen feet, the dust grows\nsufficiently compressed to support some weight. By\ncarefully walking over the same areas generation after generation, the giants have compacted the silt\nand created a sort of trail beneath the dust at a\ndepth of about twelve feet.\nraid.\nI should add that many advanced clerics who worship the element of earth have developed the ability\nto pass through stone, earth, sand, and the like as if\nthey were walking through air. Of course, this ability\nalso applies to the Sea of Silt, but the cleric must\ntake care lest he be caught somewhere on the dust\nbed when his supernatural powers expire. If this\nwere to happen, he would, no doubt, suffocate just\nlike anyone else.\nSome humans employ various techniques to wade\nthrough the Sea of Silt as giants do. I know of at\nleast one place where a village trades with giants on\nan island in the sea by walking out to it on long\nstilts. They stick to established paths, of course, and\nany misstep can be fatal.\nAt least one dwarven community employs large\nvehicles to traverse the sea. Although these lark\nconstructs look almost comical with their greatly\noversized wheels and relatively small carriage section, they do function very well. To provide locomotion, dwarves in the belly of the craft turn a series of\ncranks that cause the wheels to rotate, thus propelling the vehicle. A number of human communities\nhave employed similar craft, either self-built or purchased from the dwarves, and use them as merchant\nvessels. In many cases, such craft are powered by\nslaves who are chained to their work stations and\nforced to turn the wheels to the beating of a task\nmasters drum.\nLevitation\nLevitation is the last of the three most commonly\nused means of crossing the Sea of Silt. Let me clarify that I am not employing the term levitation in\nany specific sense, as wizards and psionicists are\nwont to do. By levitation, I mean any manner in\nwhich a person can cause something to float naturally or supernaturally-whether it be himself, someone else, or an object.\nBy this means, a would-be traveler uses his abilities to give something (an individual, a group, or an\nobject capable of carrying a group) the ability to\nfloat on or above the dust. After this is done, the\nfloating object also needs some means to propel it. I\nhave heard of two methods: setting up a sail, or using long poles to push off the sea bed.\nThe trouble with sails is two-fold. First, when\nthere is enough wind to use a sail, the Sea of Silt is\ninvariably covered with such a haze of dust that it is\nimpossible to navigate. Second, someone using a\nsail can only travel in the direction the wind is blowing. I have heard of geniuses who have experimented with keels and rudders, trying to use various\ncombinations of opposing forces to control the direction in which they move. Unfortunately, however,\nthe dust lacks the cohesive tension to make such\ncontraptions work effectively.\nPoles work better. Usually, they must be about\ntwenty-five feet long, and have some sort of square\nor circular pad on the end. The poles are pushed\nOf course, levitation suffers the same major drawback as flying. Although an object capable of carrying one or more people can be levitated, when the\nspell or lifting power wears off, that object sinks just\nlike anything else. Add to this the disadvantage of\nhaving to propel the craft or person being levitated,\nas well as the navigational difficulties that one is\nbound to encounter on the many windy days in the\nsea, and it seems to me that levitation is a much\ndown through the dust until the pads reach the\ncompressed layer of silt at fifteen to twenty feet, and\nthen the craft can be pushed forward.\n41</p>\n<p>inferior way of moving across the great basin of\ndust.\nGeography of the Sea of Silt\nBy far and away, the most common feature in the\nSea of Silt is mile after mile of dust. From the descriptions of those who have dared to venture out\ninto this vast pool of powder, all that one sees ninetynine days out of a hundred is an endless ocean of\npearly gray silt-especially if he travels straight toward the heart of the sea.\nMudflats\nOccasionally, a traveler will come across a\nmudflat. Mudflats are areas where traces of water\nseep-up through the floor of the Sea of Silt, turning\nthe dust above it into mud. Usually, mudflats are\nbetween fifty and five hundred yards in diameter.\nThey are lushly vegetated by bushes and small trees\nthat protrude from the thick layer of silt.\nSometimes, if the wind has blown the dust away\nand left the mud exposed to the crimson rays of the\nsun, the surface of the mudflat will be dried and\ncracked. The resulting crust is usually strong\nenough to support a mans weight. If this is not the\ncase, the man will find himself wallowing waist\ndeep in mud and dust. This could be a serious hazard, for most mudflats are controlled by ferocious\nbeasts that preys on whatever comes to feed on the\nvegetation. Although their prey is usually avian,\nthey are not adverse to feasting on land-bound\ntravelers who have made the trip to their islands.\nThe traveler who sees a mudflat and takes its\nlush vegetation to indicate the presence of water\nwill be sorely disappointed. All of the water seeping\nout of the sea bed is quickly absorbed by the silt\nand turns to mud. This poses no problem for\nplants, which draw water from mud with their\nroots. The animals that inhabit mudflats can usually get all the water they need from their prey or\nfrom plants. Animals like men, however, that must\nland. Like the sea itself, they are filled with dust\nand are nearly impossible for humans and demihumans to traverse. In many instances, they protrude so far inland that they form considerable\nbarriers to travel. At the same time, these estuaries\nserve as passageways for the strange creatures that\ninhabit the Sea of Siltmany of which can be\nnearly as devastating to crops, villages, and other\nhuman interests as a pack of mad thri-kreen or a\nhungry herd of wild erdlus.\nNear the shores of the Sea of Silt, there are long,\nrelatively narrow estuaries that twist their way inEstuaries\nThe plants and animals that spring up on the\nmudflats are both intriguing and deadly. Long,\nropy vines dangle from forests of towering, nakedtrunked trees capped by umbrellas of huge\nfrondlike leaves. The undergrowth is a thick tangle\nof ferns, thick-bladed grasses, and broad-leafed\nplants that spill out of single, bulbous roots. Some\nof the vines are carnivorous, and will attempt to entwine and strangle any creature lounging or passing beneath them. The thick-bladed grasses can\nalso be dangerous, for they sometimes have edges\nas sharp as an obsidian sword that will slice unprotected skin open.\nness, there is no free water. Even digging clear to\nthe bottom of the Sea of Dust will not produce a\nsingle cup of the precious fluid. There are those, I\nam told, who have used various processes similar to\ndistillation to obtain small quantities of water from\nthe mudflats. I have never done this myself, nor do\nI know of anyone who has, but I can only imagine\nthat the resulting liquid is hardly fit for any but the\nparched and dying.\ndrink their water in more-or-less pure form, have a\nmore difficult problem; despite the mudflats lush4 2</p>\n<p>As in the Sea of Silt itself, plants rarely grow in the\nshifting dust of the estuaries. Except for the periodic\nflying beast, a few silt horrors, and an occasional giant, the estuaries are empty of animal life.\nIslands\nIn the estuaries and near the shore of the Sea of\nSilt, hundreds of islands poke out of the dust. These\nis often serve as a refuge for predatory creatures that can fly. In many cases, they also serve as a\nhaven for giants and other raiders who have the\nability to cross a few miles of deep silt.\nBecause they are rarely visited, and tend to be\nlocated in vicinities that Defilers have no reason to\nfrequent, islands often have an abundant supply of\nfoliage. This makes them ideal for hermits and\nsmall tribes of herders. Of course, those who are\nblessed with such homes tend to be very territorial\nabout their islands. Strangers are usually chased\naway, if not killed to keep word of the bountiful island from spreading.\nThe only oases in the Sea of Silt are located on\nthe islands, for any large and continuing supply of\nwater that seeps into the dust bed quickly becomes\na mudflat. Unfortunately, the inhabitants of islands are secretive about water, so it is difficult to\ndetermine whether or not there is an oasis on most\nislands. I assume, however, that islands are as likely\nor unlikely as any other piece of similar land to\nhave an oasis, so you may judge your chances of\nfinding water on an island according the type of\nterrain that is upon it.\nThe islands have an abundance of plant and animal life upon them. Columnlike conifers that rise to\nheights of thirty or forty feet are not uncommon, as\nare wild orchards of smaller olive trees. The slopes\n4 3</p>\n<p>are often covered with tangles of woody vines, and\nthere are entire fields of brightly colored flowers. If\ngiants inhabit the island, they have generally destroyed most of the dangerous plants. But other islands often have a wide assortment of deadly\nfoliage, from broad-leafed vines that attempt to\nmummify anything wandering through them to\ninnocent-looking flowers whose pollen is a deadly\npoison.\nThe giants keep the islands they inhabit clear of\ndangerous animals, and generally one finds only\ncommon herd animals such as goats and erdlus in\nsuch places. Other islands, however, often have ferocious, mid-sized predators like the deadly gaj\n(described in Chapter Five: Monsters of Athas).\nRuins\nLike the rest of Athas, the Sea of Silt has its fair\nshare of ruins. The ruins of several ancient cities still\nstand on the shores of the dusty sea. In many cases,\nabandoned towers poke their crowns clear of the silt\nmore than a mile from shore, and the city walls run\ninto the sea. Whether or not the sea was always\nfilled with dust, these half-buried cities suggest that\nthe Sea of Silt is constantly growing larger and\ndeeper.\nMany of the islands also have ruins, though on a\nmuch smaller scale. On some, an ancient castle\nstill overlooks a bay or sits atop the highest hill.\nLong forgotten villages jut out of the dust. Some\nexplorers have even reported seeing great crafts\nbuilt entirely of long-since petrified wood-lying\nhalf-buried in the silt. Some have suggested that\nthese vessels were once huge boats, which does not\nseem unlikely if one allows that the sea was once\nfilled with water. They resemble great wagons, save\nthat they have no wheels or skids and are more or\nless barrel-shaped on the bottom. The only conceivable way that they could ever have moved is to\nhave floated on water or been levitated by some terrific magic.\nNo matter what method of travel they chose, all\nexplorers may expect many encounters with flying\ncreatures. Flocks of predatory birds and flesh-eating\nbats circle above the drifting sands, while bloodsucking insects (both large and small) seem always\nto be close by.\nFlying Creatures\nDespite its bleakness, the Sea of Silt is not exactly\ndeserted. Those who journey there can expect to\nfind plenty of adventure -though little of the kind I\nsuspect they would prefer. As one might expect,\nthere is no abundance of intelligent races. On the\nother hand, there are more than enough voracious\nmonsters for any man to meet in one lifetime. Here\nfollows a list of the kinds of creatures most commonly reported by explorers of the Sea of Silt.\nEncounters in the Sea of Silt\nWhat the secret of the fabled city is, I leave you\nto judge for yourself. Perhaps it is no more than a\nlegend. Perhaps it is a ghost from a better time.\nPerhaps, after all, there is a real city somewhere\nout there. Let me know if you discover the truth.\nNo one I know has ever claimed to have visited the\nfabled city. According to the stories which pass from\none traveler to another, however, dozens of explorers\nhave tried to return to the place where they saw the\nfabled city-and all they found was dust.\nAfter the storm passed, and the dust was settling\nback to the sea, they saw a magnificent city surrounded by lush fields and filled with towering fruit\ntrees. As they tried to approach the city, the wind\nrose and obscured its exact location with a pearly\nveil of silt.\nMany of the travelers to whom I have spoken\nclaim to know explorers who have ventured deep into the heart of the Sea of Silt. Several of the explorers told of being lost in a terrible storm that nearly\nkilled them.\nFabled City of Plenty\n44</p>\n<p>These encounters seem to occur more often near\nshore, especially in estuaries where the islands were\nnot populated by intelligent races. Usually, the encounters resulted in a predatory attack. Often, as\nmany members of the explorers party perished by\nfalling into the Sea of Silt as by being killed by the\nattacking monster.\nGiants\nMany explorers have reported unpleasant meetings with giants. Uniformly, these encounters occurred when the explorer and/or his party went\nashore on a giants island without first being invited.\nIn these instances, the giant would defend his territory savagely, not stopping to listen to any sort of\nreasoning.\nOn the other hand, if the explorers first circumnavigated the island and used some means to signal\nthe inhabitants, any giants living there were usually\nhappy to receive the travelers as honored guests. Of\ncourse, not all islands are inhabited by giants, so\nexplorers have reported many instances when announcing their arrival brought them nothing but a\nswift attack from some hungry predator.\nMudfiends\nAs mentioned earlier, predators often lurk on\nmudflats. Oft en, these predators are various manners of flying beasts found elsewhere in the world,\nlike wyverns. As soon as any prey comes to feed on\nthe lush vegetation, they spring out of their hiding\nplaces and attack.\nThe most dangerous of these beasts are kluzds,\nten-foot reptiles who live only in muddy areas, which\nmeans predominantly on the mudflats. Few explorers have actually seen a kluzd (pronounced\nkloozd), but many of them have had encounters\nwith the snake-like creatures.\nUsually, it happens this way: shortly after setting\nfoot on a mudflat, someone notices a pressure ridge\nforming in the silt-covered mud. This pressure ridge\nNo one seems to know for sure what the tentacles\nare attached to, though I have heard a third-hand\naccount describing a horrid beast. According to this\naccount (which, I must emphasize, may be unreliable), a mage was flying over the Sea of Silt when he\nsaw a wading giant attacked by some of the tentacles.\nOccasionally, explorers are attacked by huge\nwhite tentacles that shoot out of the Sea of Silt.\nThese tentacles wrap themselves around whatever\nthey touch-man, beast, object-and try to pull it\ndown to the dust bed. Usually, of course, wading or\nlevitating explorers are most susceptible to such attacks, but Ive heard stories of tentacles attacking\nthose who fly within twenty feet of the surface.\nSilt Horrors\nWhen the wind has exposed the mudflat and left\nthe mud to dry into a hard crust, however, the\nkluzds can be even more dangerous. Apparently,\nthey mate under such conditions, for two of them\noften burst through the crust and attack simultaneously. The kluzds will each drag a victim down to\ntheir muddy nest for their young to feed upon, then\nreturn to get another victim for themselves. If the\nattack comes at night, some explorers have even reported dozens of kluzd young pouring out of the\nholes created by their parents to gnaw upon the\nwounded and dead.\nparently having retreated. The victim is never seen\nagain (presumably because he has been eaten). Fortunately, kluzds are not overly voracious and tend to\nbe solitary creatures, so only one victim is usually\ntaken in this manner.\nmakes a beeline straight for one member of the party, who usually tries to flee. His efforts generally\navail him little, however, for the ridge quickly\ncatches up with him. Little, if any, can be seen of the\nmonster as it drags its screaming prey beneath the\nsurface of the mudflat. If the victim struggles, the\nmud and silt in the area may be churned for a short\nperiod. Then the ground grows still, the kluzd ap4 5</p>\n<p>During the struggle, the giant managed to pull a\ngruesome white creature with a fleshy, bulbous body\nout of the dust bed. The things body was as malleable as soft clay, and the giant could never get a handle on it. Eventually, the thing wrapped itself\naround the giants head. He screamed, then fell\nand disappeared in a cloud of dust. I have dubbed\nthese monsters silt horrors.\nTablelands\nThe Sea of Silt is surrounded on all sides by the\nTablelands, a band of relatively flat terrain ranging\nfrom less than fifty miles wide to more than four\nhundred. This is where the civilization of the ancients flourished, at least if we are to judge by all the\nruins they left. It is here that the remnants of civilization cling to a few verdant oases today.\nGenerally, the Tablelands are arid, hot, and barren. Even on windless days, the sky is filled with a\nyellow-green haze of floating silt. The crimson sun\nblazes with merciless fervor, and the breeze feels like\nthe hot breath of the dragon itself. The ground is\nparched and desolate, either baked to ceramic hardness or so lacking in moisture that it has the consistency of fine powder. Here and there, thorny bushes\nand clumps of spiny grass cling to the soil, waiting\nfor the once-in-a-decade rain in order to release\ntheir seeds.\nThe plains of the Tablelands are home to a wide\nvariety of societies composed of all races. Here, the\ntraveler will find hermits, thri-kreen packs, nomad\ntribes, villages, and the few cities that remain. He\nwill meet people of all races and classes; human\nslaves, elven nobles, and even, in one or two cases,\nhalfling merchants. The Tablelands are the great\nmixing bowl of Ath as, where the different cultures\nof many people are forced to fuse or clash.\nThis is not, by any means, to say that the Tablelands are tame. In the Tyr region alone, there are\ntens of thousands of square miles of plains, and I\nam sure that fewer than a million people live in that\nareamost of them in cities, villages, or other\ngroups located near a good source of water. By and\nlarge, the plains are empty and wild, populated by\nuntamed tribes and savage beasts. All in all, the Tablelands are an excellent place for adventure-and\ndeath.\nTravel in the Tablelands\nWe have all seen wizards and elemental clerics of\nthe air merrily riding the currents over our heads,\nbut flying is hardly a common method of travel.\nMost Athasians must choose between two slower,\nmore tiresome options: walking or riding.\nW a l k i n g\nWalking is by far the most inexpensive and reliable mode of transportation, but (unless you are an\nelf) it is also one of the slowest and most dangerous.\nOn a good road, an average human or demihuman\ncan walk about two miles an hour for a maximum of\nten hours a day. This means he can travel about\ntwenty miles a day.\nAt this rate, it takes him about nine days to travel\nthe 170 miles from Tyr to Urik. Although this\nmight not seem like a terribly long trip to one who\nhas not attempted it, let me assure you that it is a\nreal test of endurance.\nFirst, travelers must carry enough food and water to make the trip. At the least, a human needs\none good meal and a gallon of water each day to\nsurvive. Even this assumes that he spends the hottest part of the day sitting in the shade and limits\nhis traveling to the cool hours after dusk and before\ndawn. Therefore, he must load himself down with\nnine gallons of water, weighing about one hundred\npounds, for his nine day trip. If he knows where the\noases are along the route, and wishes to take the\nchance that there will be nothing to prevent him\nfrom using them, he can get along with much less\nwater.\nOf course, he will need a few pounds of food,\nunless he wishes to take the time to hunt or forage\n46</p>\n<p>each day-which means he will be able to spend less\ntime walking and must therefore carry more water.\nIn addition, hell need a weapon to defend himself,\nfor even if he does not run into any unfriendly strangers, the desert is full of hungry beasts-most of\nwhich he cannot hope to outrun on his own.\nFurther, of course, he must consider the unexpected. What happens if he is delayed by a sandstorm,\nor loses track of (or is chased off of) the established\ntrails. What happens if he has some (or all) of his\nsupplies stolen by scavengers, or is injured in an accident? It should be obvious by now that the answer\nto most of these questions is simply: he dies.\nWalking is fine if the traveler is interested in transporting himself and/or something small and light\nfrom one place to another. It is far from safe, however, is very slow, and is anything but an ideal method of moving cargo.\nRiding\nThere are two forms of riding: mounted, or in a\nwagon. Mounted is the fastest form of travel. Usually, mounted travelers ride kanks, for these giant\ninsects are hardy, swift, and docile. They move at an\naverage rate of four miles an hour, and cover forty\nmiles or more a day. The kanks could probably cover half again as much distance, but few riders can\nendure more than ten hours of kank riding.\nKanks need no water when on the move. They\nfeed themselves by foraging at night, and they can\ncarry a hundred pounds of equipment or supplies in\naddition to their riders. Their greatest advantage\nbecomes apparent in an emergency, however; even\nfully loaded, kanks can run at forty miles an hour\nfor distances of ten miles or more. It is no wonder\nthat most explorers and adventurers prefer kanks\nover every other form of travel.\n4 7</p>\n<p>Wagon travel is used primarily by caravans. Any\nbeast of burden can be used to draw a wagon, but\nmost wagon caravans prefer mekillots. Standing as\nhigh as twelve feet at the shoulder and weighing as\nmuch as ten tons, these monstrous lizards move\nalong at a plodding pace of two miles an hour for\nfifteen hours a day, pulling behind them fortress\nwagons loaded with dozens of guards, passengers,\nsupplies, and cargo. When attacked, these fearsome lizards turn into gargantuan terrors, stomping, biting, and tongue-lashing their opponents to\ndeath. At the same time, it is nearly impossible to\nkill a mekillot for its hide is so thick that many weapons simply will not penetrate it.\nDespite their toughness, mekillots have several\ndisadvantages. First, they are carnivores. Toward\nthe end of a long journey, they begin to cast hungry\nglances at their handlers. In fact, more than one\ndriver has disappeared when he went to check the\nmekillots.\nSecond, they must drink every four or five days.\nThis process takes an entire day. The typical mekillot will drink about two hundred gallons of water\nbefore it quenches its thirst, but its stomach holds\nonly fifty gallons at a time. It requires several trips\nback to the well for the beasts body to store all the\nwater it needs.\nThird, the huge wagons drawn by mekillot teams\ncan only travel on well-established roads or on extremely flat terrain like salt flats. Otherwise, the\nwagons tend to roll over or bog down.\nFinally, the only thing that a mekillot can outrun\nis another mekillot. Parties traveling in these huge\nwagons are committing themselves to a fight if something should decide to attack them, for fleeing is out\nof the question.\nGeography of the Tablelands\nI may speak of the Tablelands as if they are a single type of terrain, but this is far from true. The\nTablelands consist of six different kinds of land:\nstony barrens, sandy wastes, salt flats, rocky badlands, scrub plains, and inland silt basins. Each is\nas different from the other as the Sea of Silt is from\nthe Ringing Mountains. They are lumped together\nfor the purposes of geographical description. All occur in the same general area, but no one should\nmake the mistake of assuming that the similarity\ngoes much beyond their location.\nStony Barrens\nStony barrens are the most common type of terrain in the Tablelands. They consist primarily of\nlarge sheets of exposed bedrock-mostly orange-red\nsandstone. Of course, the bedrock is constantly being weathered away, so the barrens are littered with\nstones ranging in size from pebbles to boulders.\nLarge areas of rock are covered by a thick layer of\nred dirt, as well as waist-high drifts of coarse orange\nsand and puffy heaps of yellow dust.\nIf you have any other choice, dont travel across\nopen ground on stony barrens. Unless youre traveling on a road or well-worn path, the loose rocks\nmake footing treacherous. Humans and demihumans (including elves) can move at only half their\nnormal walking speed when traveling these areas.\nKanks can travel at standard walking speed, but not\nany faster.\nOn the other hand, mekillots barely notice the\nchange in footing, for their great weight grinds rocks\ninto powder. However, only a fool would try to pull a\nwagon through this terrain; even the sturdiest\nwheels would be pulverized within a matter of miles.\nFlora and Fauna\nFor every rock in the stony barrens, there are a\ndozen thorns. Cactus grows everywhere and in every\nconceivable shape: squat spheres covered by long\nyellow needles, twisted masses of ground-hugging\ntubes, tall spine-covered barrels rising as high as\ntwenty feet-even in tangled masses with tree-like\nlimbs. Many of these cacti are sources of both food\nand water, provided you are willing to work your way\n4 8</p>\n<p>Sandy Wastes\npast their thorns.\nIf you are not familiar with a particular cactus,\nhowever, it is best not to attempt eating it or stealing\nwater from it. Some cacti have mobile needles that\nwill work their way deep into your flesh, not stopping\nuntil they reach your heart or another vital organ.\nThe meat or fluid of other cacti is toxic, and there\nare even a few that shoot poisoned needles at any\nanimal passing near them.\nThe fauna of the stony barrens is varied. Here,\nyou will find most of the animals of Athas: wild\nerdlus, mekillots, inix, etc. Of course, there is also\nan abundance of predators: braxat, tembo, belgoi,\nand the like.\nThe sandy wastes are what many people imagine\nwhen they think of the open desert: a vast expanse of\nyellow sand, piled into dunes of various shapes and\nsizes. There are many different kinds of dunes.\nWhere there is a strong, steady wind blowing\nfrom one direction, the dunes are called mekillot\ndunes. This is because of their great size and shape,\nwhich resembles the hump of a mekillots back.\nStretching anywhere from one-half to several miles\nin length, and lying parallel to the path of the wind,\nthese dunes often rise as high as 750 feet and can\nseem like mountains-especially if you happen to be\nthe unlucky fellow who must cross a couple of hundred miles of them on foot.\nWave dunes are the product of moderate winds\nwhich blow steadily from one direction. They look\nlike an oasis pond on a windy day, with sharp, evenly spaced ridges of sand. The crests of these dunes\nare only between fifty and a hundred feet high.\nThey are not difficult to cross, but I have known the\nregularity of their spacing to drive impatient muls\ninto a killing frenzy.\nCrescent dunes form where the sand does not completely cover the ground. They result from a onedirectional wind blowing sand more readily over the\ndunes low tips than its high center. These are my faThe other great hazard of the sandy wastes is the\nsandstorm. On a bad day, the wind howls so loud\nthat it drowns out the voice of a screaming man, and\nit stirs up so much sand that you cannot see farther\nthan a few feet in front of you. Under such circumstances, I advise you to stop wherever you are and\nwait out the storm. To do otherwise is to lose your\nway or become separated from your companions.\nWhether it lies in a flat plain or is heaped into\ngreat piles and dunes, traveling through sand is\nhard work. Human and demihuman travelers must\nrest at least twelve hours a day and have an adequate supply of food and water, or their speed\nquickly decreases and they find themselves too exhausted to continue moving.\nsalt flat and seemingly as endless as the Sea of Silt.\nSimilarly, it is heaped in great fan-shaped hills at\nthe base of the Ringing Mountains, where it spills\nout of the canyons running out of the high country.\nis no wind, it may form a yellow plain, as level as a\nOf course, not all sand lies in dunes. Where there\nIn any dune region, the traveler occasionally hears\na vibrant booming echoing across the sands. This\nmuffled thunder usually continues for five minutes\nor more, and can be so loud that you must shout to\nmake yourself heard. Druids and clerics explain this\nroaring by saying that it is caused by avalanches of\nsand tumbling down the steep slip-faces of the\ndunes. Personally, I think the elven explanation is\nmore likely: the booming is caused by the tolling\nbells of an ancient city that the dunes have buried.\nStar dunes are the most interesting. They are\ntwisted masses of sand with tentacle-like ridges extending in all directionssometimes for many miles.\nThey form in areas where wind from many directions meet, causing the dunes radial arms to twist\nback on itself. As a traveler, I have always considered star dunes my friend. Because they change\nshape slowly and seldom move far, they serve well as\nlandmarks in seas of shifting sand.\nvorite kinds of dunes, for you can almost always find a\nway to go around rather than climb over them.\n4 9</p>\n<p>Flora and Fauna\nFlora and Fauna\nPlants are few and far between in the sandy\nwastes, for they must fight a constant losing battle\nwith the wind as it works to bury them beneath a fine\nlayer of sand. Still, there are occasional clumps of\ntough grass, wiry stems of ocotillo, and scrawny\nsprays of salt brush. Most of these plants are harmless, if not nutritious, but be careful before allowing\nyour mounts to graze on anything with a purple\nhuesuch plants often drive mekillots and inix into\nmurderous rages. Kanks dont seem to be affected\nby these plants, however, I have no idea what the\npurple plants would do to a man who eats them.\nAs in the stony barrens, you will find most forms\nof animals in the sandy wastes. The anakore (see\nChapter Five: Monsters of Athas) seems to be particularly common here.\nSalt Flats\nThe salt flats are just what the name implies: immense plains of salt-crusted ground. Salt flats are\ngenerally level an packed as hard as stone, so traveling over them is fast and easy. However, forage for\npack animals and prey for hunters is all but nonexistent. Those traveling through a salt-flat are well\nadvised to take along enough food for themselves\nand their beasts.\nThey should also carry an ample supply of drinking water. Although there are oases in the salt flats,\nthe water is usually so bitter and salty that it is undrinkable. In some cases, water can be found that\nseems safe to drink, but is tainted with a slow-acting\nI have always tried to avoid travel on the salt flats,\nfor they are a harsh place. This is nowhere more evident than in the shocking lack of plant and animal\nlife found upon them. Here and there a traveler\nmight find a hearty weed or dwarf cactus, but by and\nlarge these foul regions are wholly lifeless.\nAs throughout most of the Tablelands, nearly any\nThe gulches of the rocky badlands are often covered with diminutive trees bearing tiny silver, gold,\nor purple leaves. There is also an abundance of\nlow-lying brush with serrated, silver-white leaves, as\nwell as spherical gray-yellow bushes with thorny\nstems standing as tall as a man. The twigs of the\ntrees make excellent grazing for any reptile, but\nkanks die within a few days of eating even a mouthful of these twigs. Dont let anything eat the serrated leaves of the low-lying brush, as the sharp\nleaves slice up the intestines of whatever eats them.\nFlora and Fauna\nMountains often lie at the heart of the badlands.\nUsually, these mountains are little more than massive pinnacles of stone rising far above the surrounding hills, but they are occasionally true\nmountains standing thousands of feet high. No\nmatter what their height, mountains are usually inhabited by one or two vicious creatures who consider\nany attempt to climb the peak an encroachment on\ntheir territory.\nTraveling in the badlands is not particularly\ndifficult-provided one is willing to stay in the bottom of the canyons and has no particular desire to\nmove in a straight line. Those wishing to go somewhere other than where the canyon leads quickly\ndiscover that scaling the canyon walls-often sheer\ncliffsis a practical impossibility, especially if they\nhave much cargo.\nThe rocky badlands are labyrinths of narrow,\ntwisting canyons winding their way through a region of high ground. The canyons are walled by\ncliffs of crumbling rock, and the hilltops consist of\nlittle more than knife-sharp ridges separating one\ncanyon from the next. There tend to be concentrations of oases in the badlands, so they are a natural\nhaven for hermits, raiding tribes, and creatures of\nall sorts.\nRocky Badlands\np o i s o n .\n50</p>\n<p>kind of beast can be found in the rocky badlands,\nbut tembo, belgoi, and silk wyrms are especially\ncommon.\nScrub Plains\nScrub plains are small tracts of dusty land dotted\nwith clumps of grass, thorny bushes, and occasionally even spindly trees. These tracts are relatively\nscarce in the Tablelands. Because the scrub provides the best forage available, herders tend to overgraze these plains, stripping the land of all foliage\nand reducing it to a sandy waste or stony barren.\nWhat the herders do not inadvertently destroy,\nDefilers often annihilate. Although the scrub plains\nare not lush by any standard, they contain more\nvegetation per acre than most other Athasian terrain. Because of this, Defilers are often attracted to\nthese areas when first learning their black art, practicing new spells, or trying to find a safe refuge.\nGiven the destructive pressure of these two\nforces, it is a wonder that there are any scrub plains\nat all in the Tablelands. Most of the remaining\ntracts still exist only because they are watched over\nby druids. When they realize that a Defiler has entered their territory, these druids do everything in\ntheir power to drive him from the area or kill him\nusually the latter.\nThe druids treat herders more kindly, simply\nkeeping a close eye on the herding tribes and their\nflocks. If the herders try to take their flocks into a\npasture in danger of being overgrazed, or if they\nstay in the same place too long, the druids will subtly\nguide the herders away by summoning a ferocious\ncreature or a plague of insects.\nIn cases of especially dense or stubborn herders,\nthe action may be more severe. I was once traveling\nwith a party of elven nomads who refused to move\non, even though they were perfectly aware that they\nwere angering the local druid. The standoff finally\nended with the druid opening the earth and swallowing the tribes entire camp. No elven lives were\nlost, but the herders had to resort to raiding in order\nThose traveling across an inland silt basin must\nuse the same methods as those traveling in the Sea\nof Silt itself, and can expect to meet the same hazards.

There are rumors\nthat certain hidden pathways follow the course of\nlong buried city walls.

With the\ngeneral exception of silt horrors, the information\npresented above for the Sea of Silt can be assumed\nto apply to Silt Basins as well.\nRuins\nThe Tablelands are fairly covered with ruins. Decaying towers rise out of the sandy wastes. Abandoned fortresses loom over the stony barrens. The\nwhite-crusted crowns of half-buried palaces protrude\nfrom the salt flats. Long-lost dungeons lie tucked away\nin the hidden corners of badlands labyrinths.\nThe architecture of these ruins, both in the great\ncities and in the isolated buildings, is that of ancients, with an abundance of gracefully arched\ndoors, windows, and gates. The walls and towers\nare built of thousands of more-or-less flat rocks,\ncarefully shaped and fitted into place, then mortared with lime cement. The top of the towers and\nwalls are capped by square crenelations designed\nto protect men as they defended the top of the wall.\nGenerally, the windows of the exterior walls are no\nmore than slits through which soldiers can fire\nbows and crossbows at besiegers outside the castle. \nThe interior walls are more generous, large enough\nto let an ample amount of light and air into the\ndank rooms.\nThe most common ruins are solitary remnants of\nthe glorious age that preceded ours. As you travel\nthrough the Tablelands, youll find bridges spanning long dead riverbeds that have not known the\ntaste of water in centuries. Youll cross cobblestone\nlanes laid down more than a thousand years ago,\nand if you turn to follow them youll pass shattered\nguard towers that must have seemed like lonely and\nforlorn posts even when the road ran heavy with\ntraffic. Most oft en, these ruins are simply places to\nhide from the sweltering sun or take shade from the\nThe eight cities that I know of (and have visited\npersonally) are described in Chapter Four: Atlas\nIn the Tablelands of the Tyr region, a handful of\nruined cities lie half-buried in dust, sand, or salt. Although the locations of these cities are well known,\nthey are relatively untouched. Exploring a city ruin is a\nmajor undertaking, for they cover tens of thousands of\nacres and are often buried beneath a thick layer of\nwindblown sediment. In addition, most serve as either\nthe home of a raiding tribe or the lair of dozens of\nvicious creatures, so it is common for adventurers entering city ruins to not return.\nThe largest castles are surrounded by villages.\nMost of the village buildings have long-since collapsed, and their walls have disappeared, but valuable items such as coins, weapons, and metal tools\nand utensils still lie among the foundations. There is\nusually a large, ruined stone building that once\nserved as a temple where the ancients practiced their\nreligion. The vaults beneath these temples sometimes contain vast treasures. Unfortunately, those\nwho have entered these temples also report finding\nunusual numbers of strange creaturesboth living\nand undead.\nAlthough not as common as the solitary bridges\nand towers of the previous age, more substantial ruins are not rare. Archaic castles stand along ancient\nroads and dry riverbeds. Even if the castle itself has\nbeen reduced to a ruin, the foundations often still\nexist. The dark rooms and twisting tunnels inside\nthose foundations sometimes contain valuable\nweapons and other treasuresbut like the ruins of\nthe previous age, they are also prime lairs for vicious\ncreatures.\nmerciless wind. Occasionally, there will be a hidden opening that leads to a basement or lost tunnel\nsystem. Sometimes, these subterranean tunnels\neven hold priceless treasuresan ancient steel\nsword or breastplate, for example. Just as often,\nthey serve as home to some vicious or brutish creature that will appreciate an unexpected meal entering its lair.\n52</p>\n<p>middle of salt flats, hidden in the labyrinths of the\nof the Tyr Region. The vast majority of these ruined cities date from ancient times. In many ways,\nthey resemble the ancient village ruins, save that\neverything is on a much grander scale. In the center of a city, there is a massive fortress-town in place\nof a castle. There is dozens of huge temples instead\nof a single small one; there are thousands of collapsed buildings, each with a cellar or basement in\nits foundation. Finally, most have large subterranean sewers and catacombs into which much of the\ncitys treasure has been dragged over the centuries\nby successive generations of monsters.\nOf course, there may well be cities that no one has\ndiscovered yet. Who has not heard stories of a lost\ncity of steel lying buried beneath a mammoth mekillot dune, or listened in awe to the bards who sing of\nTwo of the ruined cities that I know of date from\nour own era. Of course, they resemble our modern\ncities in layout. The prime areas of economic importance (the merchant emporiums, the noble estates,\nthe templar houses, and the sorcerer-kings fortress)\nhave already been thoroughly explored and looted.\nThere is little reason to visit these two cities except\nfor curiositys sake. Considering what abides there\nnow, I am not that curious.\nthe dwarves Lost City of Gold?\nEncounters in the Tablelands\nAnyone traveling in the Tablelands is assured of a\nwide variety of adventures. To be certain, not all will\nbe pleasant, but they will be interesting-provided\nthe traveler survives, of course.\nCities\nSeldom will an alert traveler encounter a city by\nsurprise. The locations of all cities in the Tablelands\nare well known, and they all lie along the course of\nwell-traveled roads. In addition, most cities are surrounded by a wide swath of cultivated land, as well\nas service roads for moving wagons, water, and\nslaves about without injuring crops. Further, there is\na constant stream of travel within several miles of the\ngates. In short, not even a blind man could approach a city without realizing it.\nOf course, it is always possible for a wanderer to\ncrest a hill and discover to his surprise that a city lies\nin the valley below. Even in this case, he will not be\nlost for long. Any passing caravan driver will tell\nhim where he is-though the wanderer may have to\nsuffer a few bemused remarks for having to ask such\na foolish question.\nIn the Tyr region, there are seven cities: Tyr,\nUrik, Gulg, Balic, Raam, Nibenay, and Dral. The\nname and location of each is well known, and all a\ntraveler must do reach any one of them is set foot\nonto the proper road and start walking. In most\ncases, entry into a city is simple. Unless the traveler\nis carrying banned goods (be especially careful\nabout anything that could be used as a magical\ncomponent), the gate guards simply record the travelers name and reason for visiting a city, collect a\ntariff (and/ or bribe) for any cargo the traveler is carrying, and then let him enter. Each citys unique\natmosphere and flavor is detailed in the Atlas of the\nTyr Region later in this book.\nVillages\nVillages are far from common; it is quite possible\nto travel for hundreds of miles without coming\nacross a single one. On the other hand, you will find\nthem in the most unexpected places: standing in the\nrocky badlands, and clinging to the sides of isolated\nmountains.\nThe reception given a party of strangers depends\nupon the nature of the village they encounter. Other\nthan offering them food and water; a dwarven village might hardly notice the strangers. A slave or\nraiding village, on the other hand, might well attempt to imprison or slay them.\nSome villages are described in the Atlas of the\nTyr Region, which appears later in this book. However, villages tend to be temporary communities, so\n5 3</p>\n<p>it would be futile to describe them all. Besides, there\nare no doubt dozens of villages of which I have not\nheard. For a general description of what to expect\nwhen you run into a village, I suggest you consult\nVillages in Chapter Two: Athasian Society.\nCaravans\nAnyone traveling a major road will certainly encounter caravans of all sizes and descriptions. If\nthey wish, they can usually purchase passage with a\ncaravan in return for money or labor-provided\nthey dont appear menacing or threatening. The\nprimary benefit of caravan passage is safety, not\ncomfort; often, passengers provide their own food\nand transportation, purchasing only the protection\nof the caravans guards.\nSmall caravans, usually mounted on banks, can be\nfound off the main roads. Those traveling away from\nthe road are usually carrying supplies to an outpost\nor village. Caravans traveling toward the road are\ngenerally carrying raw materials, such as clay, obsidian chips, or even beads of smelted iron. Unlike most\ncaravans, these off-road caravans seldom take passengers. To safeguard against raiders and competitors, Merchant Houses place a high priority on\nkeeping the location of their outposts secret.\nFor more information on caravan organization,\ntake a look at the section I have entitled Caravans,\nlocated under Dynastic Merchant Houses in Chapter Two: Athasian Society.\nPeople of the Tablelands\nMost of the Tablelands are bleak and savage, but\nthey are far from deserted. When you travel in these\nareas, youll meet representatives of all races, including nomads, raiders, hermits, and hunters.\nEach group tends to be found in the type of terrain\nbest suited to its lifestyle. Nomadic herders are\nmore common in the scrub lands. Raiders tend to\nhide in the labyrinths of the badlands, and hermits\nprefer to live at out-of-the-way oases. Hunters are\nMost of the creatures described in Chapter Five:\nMonsters of Athas can be found in the Tablelands.\nIf the herbivores are dangerous, the carnivores are\na truly nightmarish. Intelligent races receive no special consideration in the deserts of Athas. In fact,\nmany predators consider them a special delicacy\nand lurk near places where human and demihuman\nraces conglomerate-i.e., near villages, roads, oases, etc. When you travel outside any city, always\nassume that youre being stalked by something as\nlarge as a mekillot, as quiet as a halfling, as fast as\nan elf, and as vicious as a mulchances are that\nyou will be correct.\nA wide variety of creatures inhabit the Tablelands. All are dangerous, for Athas is a harsh place\nwith one natural law that prevails over all others: kill\nor be killed. Even animals which subsist entirely on\nplants have deadly defenses, for they must fight off\nvicious predators almost daily. My advice to the\nhungry traveler thinking to make an easy meal of\nany innocuous-looking beast is this: be as prepared\nto fight for your life as the animal you are hunting\nwill be to fight for its own.\nAnimals\nEach of the groups mentioned above is described\nmore fully in Chapter Two: Athasian Society.\nyou receive will depend on their nature and your\nown attitude. If you appear frightened, most natives\nwill try to take advantage of you; if you seem hostile,\ntheyll want to fight; if youre arrogant, they wont\ndo anything to help you. In general, I have found\nthat it is best to appear confident and courteous.\nThis implies that you have the strength to defend\nyourself, yet have no harmful intentions.\nfound wherever there is prey: stony barrens, sandy\nwastes, rocky badlands, and the scrub plains. Of\ncourse, these guidelines are not hard or fast; to survive, the races of the desert must be flexible and mobile, so you shouldnt be surprised to find any group\nin any terrain.\nWhen you meet a group of natives, the responses\n54</p>\n<p>The herbivores tend to inhabit the types of terrain\ndescribed as their natural habitat, and will seldom\nbe found in other locales, unless some natural or\nunnatural event has forced them to leave their home\nterrain. On the other hand, the carnivores move\nthrough all terrains freely, either pursuing prey or\nsearching for it in places that they know it frequents.\nThe Ringing Mountains\nMountain ranges encircle the Tablelands, each\nrunning north and south. To the east and west of\nthe Sea of Silt, they form great wall-like barriers separating the Tablelands from the unknown lands beyond. To the north and south of the Sea of Silt, they\nform a series of parallel ribs. The deep valleys between these ribs lead away from central Athas like a\nseries of long corridors.\nI have visited only the mountains lying west of Tyr,\nso remember that my comments reflect experiences\nthere. These mountains more or less separate the\nHinterlands from the Tablelands, whereas the\nmountains north and south of the Sea of Silt form\nlong passageways connecting the Hinterlands and\nthe Tablelands.\nIt is entirely conceivable that this terrain difference will have a profound effect on the societies in\nthose areas. After all, in the Tyr region, the mountains are a barrier separating this part of Athas\nfrom whatever lies beyond. In the northern and\nsouthern regions, the mountains are like funnels\nthat guide travel between the two areas along certain\nrigid tracks. Keeping this warning in mind, then, let\nus explore the Ringing Mountains.\nFrom a distance of a hundred miles, the Ringing\nMountains look like a ridge of reddish clouds hugging the horizon. As you move closer, their soft edges\n5 5</p>\n<p>gradually grow sharper and more distinct. At a distance of fifty miles, the craggy shape of individual\npeaks becomes visible. Between twenty and thirty\nmiles, you start to climb great, fan-shaped heaps of\ncoarse sand washed down out of the canyons. After\nyouve struggled to within five miles of the mountains, the range takes on the appearance of a great\nwall of loose rock and sheer cliff.\nAt this point, weak-hearted travelers often despair of crossing the mountains and turn back.\nDont make this mistake. As you trudge forward,\nyoull discover that the mountains are not nearly as\ninhospitable as they look. Traveling in them is simply a matter of keeping your wits about you and\nmoving forward with a slow, steady pace.\nMethods of Travel\nIn the mountains, the only reliable means of\ntransport is walking. You can ride kanks many miles\nup the canyons that wind and twist into the heart of\nthe range, but eventually youll reach a boulder\nfield or rocky escarpment where it would be dangerous to remain mounted. On treacherous terrain, extra weight can easily cause even a sure-footed kank\nto loose its balance and fall-spilling the passenger\ninto a boulder field or plunging both mount and\nrider hundreds of feet to their deaths. In fact,\nthere are many places, such as the cliffs at the canyon heads, where kanks cannot even travel.\nTherefore, if you are going to travel very far in the\nRinging Mountains, sooner or later you will have to\nrely upon your own two feet. Unfortunately, walking\nin the mountains is even slower and more tedious\nthan in the desert. It is impossible to travel a straight\nline in the mountains. Your path always bends and\nturns as you move around obstacles such as cliffs,\nhigh peaks, deep crevices, and so forth. Even then,\nyou must hike hundreds of feet up or down, often\nboth, for every mile traveled horizontally.\nIn addition to the extra effort of travel, one must\nalways be on the lookout for the many hazards of the\nmountains. First and foremost, losing your footing\ncan be deadly. Even if the slip does not send you\nplunging down the mountain, it may result in an injury that will make it impossible to travel when the\ngoing becomes truly hazardous. Second, the mountains are full of hiding places where dangerous creatures and desperate characters can wait to ambush\nunwary travelers. Third, the mountains grow extremely cold at night, especially in the highest places.\nUnless you are wearing heavy clothing or sitting up\nall night next to a campfire (which tends to attract\nunwanted attention), it is quite possible to freeze to\ndeath-especially if you havent had much to eat.\nThere is one last inconvenience to traveling in the\nmountains: it is exhausting. Of course, hour after\nhour of climbing hundreds of feet up and down is\nbound to take its toll on a person, but the weariness\nof which I speak goes far beyond that. As you travel\nhigher, it almost seems that some magical force is\ntrying to hold you back. Breathing becomes difficult, until even walking a hundred yards is enough\nto leave you panting and gasping. You begin to feel\nlight-headed and dizzy, then sick to your stomach.\nYou lose all desire to go on, and want nothing so\nmuch as to collapse and sleep forever. Even water\nloses its appeal, and the thought of eating seems\nmore trouble than it is worth.\nI have seen full-grown men lie in the same spot\nfor more than a day, not bothering to eat the food\nin their satchels and barely drinking enough from\ntheir full waterskins to keep themselves from dying.\nThis strange malaise seems to affect half-giants\nand elves more than most other races, to the point\nwhere I would advise them not to enter the mountains without a trusted member of another race\nwho will remind them to eat and drink, as well as\nprod them to continue moving. On the other hand,\nalthough dwarves grow as tired as anybody else,\nthe characteristic determination of their race renders them all but immune to the lethargy so dangerous to others.\nGiven all of the complications of voyaging in the\nmountains, most parties should be happy if they can\n56</p>\n<p>Geography of the Ringing Mountains\nmaintain a travel rate a equaling quarter of their\nnormal distance. It should also be noted that the\nfatigue of traveling in the mountains has no effect\non running speeds (as long as one is not moving\nacross treacherous terrain, of course). When the individual finally has to rest, however, it takes twice as\nlong as normal to recoverand if the exertion was\nespecially intense, he may feel sick and lethargic.\nThe Ringing Mountains are composed of four\npredominate terrains: the foothills, the canyons, the\nmountains, and the forest ridge. Although each is\ndistinguished from the other in many ways, it is\nsometimes difficult to tell where one region ends and\nthe other begins. At the base of the mountain\nrange, steep hills rise to either side of the sand\nheaped at the mouth of the canyons, and before you\nknow it you have entered a canyon that winds deep\ninto the foothills. The foothills gradually grow steeper and rockier, imperceptibly making the transition\ninto full-fledged mountains.\nOther times, the transitions are more obvious. A\nrocky slope suddenly ends in a cliff that plunges\nhundreds or thousands of feet down to a canyons\nsandy floor. At the summit of the mountain range, a\nforest of tall trees suddenly appears, their leaf-laden\nboughs swaying in the wind as if to greet a weary\ntraveler.\nWhether the transition is gradual or sudden, a\nsmart traveler will always pay attention to the terrain\nhe is in. It will provide him with valuable clues as to\nwhat he might find lurking around the next corner,\nthe kind of hazards that could come crashing down\naround his head, and what is likely to happen to\nhim if he makes a mistake.\nThe Foothills\nOn both sides of the Ringing Mountains, the\ngreat heaps of sand washed out of the mouth of the\ncanyons lie piled high against the foothills. The\nIt is also fairly easy to travel along the ridgetops\ntoward the spine of the mountains, thus avoiding\nthe possibility of being caught in a flash flood. This\nroute entails its own problems, however. Not infrequently, youll find yourself working your way along\nthe edge of a precipice that plunges hundreds or\nthousands of feet down into an abyss. When this\nhappens, forget about riding your kanks or any other beasts of burden-unless you value your life as\nWhen traveling along these seemingly dry watercourses, however, carefully watch the sky over the\nmountains ahead, and immediately climb to higher\nground if you see any dark clouds gathering up\nthere. Should a rainstorm occur over the area from\nwhich your gulch drains (not an uncommon occurrence in the mountains), a wall of water may come\nrushing down the gulch without warning. Those\ncaught in such a flash flood will almost surely\nperish-either from drowning, or by being battered\nagainst rocks as they are carried downstream.\nAssuming youre going toward (or away from) the\nsummit of the Ringing Mountains, the easiest way\nto travel through the foothills is along the bottom of\na ravine. Here there is often a dry creek bed that\nmakes a fairly nice walking surface. It is even possible to ride kanks safely in these areas, if you can get\none there in the first place. Occasionally, youll encounter a field of boulders or a steep wall of stone\nthat must be crossed or climbed, but otherwise your\ntravel should be fairly easy.\nThere are a few differences, however. The ridges\nbetween the canyons tend to be higher, and their\nsummits are often rounded and quite expansive instead of sharp and narrow. Also, as you travel toward the spine of the Ringing Mountains,\nthe\nfoothills grow more dramatic. The canyons are\ndeeper, the cliffs more impressive, and the summits\nhigher.\nfoothills generally resemble the rocky badlands of\nthe Tablelands in both appearance and terrain.\nThey are filled with narrow, twisting canyons interspersed with steep ridges of higher ground.\n5 7</p>\n<p>little as your cargo. The crumbling ground along\nthe edge of these precipices can be shifting and uncertain, and will certainly collapse if too much\nweight is concentrated in one place. Youll have to\nfigure out for yourself what is too much weight;\nsometimes the ground will support a full grown mekillot, and other times it will collapse under the\nweight of an unencumbered halfling woman.\nTraveling parallel to the spine of the Ringing\nMountains is all but impossible. Youll find yourself\nclimbing and descending ridge after ridgea slow\nand exhausting process, even if you dont fall off a\nprecipice or find yourself facing an impassable cliff.\nIts usually much wiser to go to the base of the foothills, travel the desired distance northward or southward, and then travel up a canyon or ridge that\nleads more or less where you wish to go.\nFlora and Fauna\nThe flora and fauna of the foothills is the same as\nthat found in the rocky badlands of the Tablelands.\nSee Rocky Badlands in the Tablelands section\nabove for more information about this.\nThe Canyons\nThe foothills are broken every twenty to forty\nmiles by a major canyon that leads deep into the\nheart of the mountains. These canyons are usually\nbetween one and five miles wide, and kanks can usually be ridden up to forty or fifty miles into them.\nThe first five or ten miles of canyon floor is usually\ncovered with heaps of deep sand that have been\nwashed down out of the mountains over the years.\nOften, there is quite a bit of water trapped beneath\nthese sands (having trickled or washed down from\nthe mountains), so it is not uncommon to find\ncopses of small trees, fields of grass or flowers, or\neven hedges of thorny bushes growing here.\nThese sandy fans make good grazing land, so it is\nnot uncommon to encounter nomadic herders\ncamped at their bases. The herders are usually happy to let a party of travelers pass through their territory, but tend to frown on anyone stopping to graze\ntheir animals for more than a day or two.\nFurther up, the canyon floor consists of stony barrens, and is littered liberally with boulders of all\nsizes. Here, the vegetation is a little heavier than in\nmost stony barrens, for rocky cliffs rise high on both\nsides of the canyon, providing shelter from the sun\nduring much of the day. Every ten or twenty miles,\nthere is usually a pool of water hidden in some rock\ncrevice, left behind by the last flash flood. Travelers\nshould think twice before drinking from such a pool;\noften, it has been standing stagnant for years.\nThe greatest hazard of this area comes from predatory creatures. The ample vegetation supports a\nlarge population of grazing creatures, which in turn\ndraw a larger number of carnivores. In addition, the\nconfined spaces of the canyons make it easy for hungry predators to work their territories, and there are\nplenty of crevices and fissures in which they can\nhide. Plan on losing at least a third of your pack\nanimals, and perhaps one or two of your friends, as\nyou pass through this area.\nNear the top of the canyon, you may reach a\nsteep field of boulders. Leave your mounts behind\nat this point, for even kanks cannot hope to cross\nthis treacherous terrain without breaking a leg within the first mile or so. In fact, as you cross this area,\nbe careful yourself. If you misstep even once, your\nfoot may lodge in a gap between two boulders, snapping your leg like a piece of dry wood as your momentum carries you forward.\nAs you step or jump from one boulder to another\nin this area, it is difficult to tell when your weight\nmay tip a stones balance and send you tumbling\ninto a mass of sharp-edged rocks. Even worse, the\nshifting boulder may dislodge others above, burying\nyou beneath tons of jagged rock. It is because of the\nhazard presented by boulder fields that many merchants who travel in the mountains insist on taking\nan Earth Cleric along with them; such an individual\ncan prove invaluable in stabilizing a particularly\n5 8</p>\n<p>loose area of boulders, or in moving a great mass of\nstone if a rock slide should occur.\nAbove the boulder field, near the head of the canyon, there is nearly always a large field of scrub.\nThese fields range in size from just over twenty miles\nin diameter to nearly a hundred. They exist, in my\nestimation, for three reasons. First, the boulder field\nmakes it difficult for grazing creatures to reach\nthem, so the plants live longer. Second, they are\nclose to the summit of the Ringing Mountains,\nwhich means they are close to a water supply. Third,\nthe temperatures are a little cooler at these altitudes,\nso the grasses are not punished as severely by the\nheat of the day.\nSometimes, a hermit or a small tribe of herders\nwill make their home in such areas, having carried\ntheir beasts into the field as young animals. Such\nindividuals (or tribes) are very suspicious of stranOccasionally, these high mountain meadows are\nnot protected by a boulder field. Avoid such areas\nat all costs. They are often defended so jealously by\nhostile nomads or raiding tribes that to enter them is\nto insure an ambush. If this is not the case, then\nthey are filled with nervous herbivores and ferocious\ncarnivores, all of whom will defend their territory aggressively against any intrusion.\nThe only exception to this that I know of is the\nscrub land surrounding the city of Tyr, where the\ncity nobles consider it a great sport to hunt down\ngers and protective of their territory. It is far from a\nrare occurrence for a tribe of raiders to slay them,\nsteal their herds, and make the mountain meadow\ntheir home base. Obviously, this means that anyone\nentering one of these areas stands a fair chance of\nrunning into a raiding tribe-which is never a pleasant experience.\n5 9</p>\n<p>any vicious animals that intrude upon their territory.\nThis is an exciting sport, for the nobles fall victim to\nthe animals almost as frequently as they are successful in their hunting.\nFlora and Fauna\nNear the bottom of a typical canyon, the flora\nand fauna corresponds to that of the sandy wastes\n(see Sand Dunes in the Tablelands section above).\nAt the top of the canyon, there is usually a region of\nscrub land. This area is covered with a lush carpet\nof grass, and dotted with tall, puff-ball trees bearing\nsmall waxy leaves. The wood of the trees is extremely\nhard and is excellent for making weapons, but the\ntree is otherwise inedible. Watch out for single\nblades of a tough purple grass in this area; they tend\nto grow with other clumps of grass, and are so sharp\nthat they can cut the tongue off careless beasts and\nslash the feet of unwary travelers to ribbons.\nIn place of the cacti of the rocky barrens, the midranges of the canyons are covered by dagger plants.\nThese strange plants have dozens of long, daggershaped leaves that radiate out as much as three feet\nfrom a central core at the top of the plants root.\nEach leaf ends in a sharp needle. The needle is\ntipped with a mild poison, and paralyzes any limb it\npokes will be paralyzed for up to ten days. Some varieties of these plants have leaf edges as sharp as an\nobsidian blade.\nMost kinds of animals can be found in the canyons, especially those of the predatory variety. Fortunately, since animals in the canyons are very\nterritorial, once you have dealt with the primary\npredators, chances are you will not be attacked\nagain. Mountain gith can be a real hazard in these\ncanyons.\nThe Mountains\nIf your intention is to cross the Ringing Mountains, or even to reach their summit, sooner or later\nyoull have climb the mountains themselves.\nAssuming you have the necessary willpower to\ncontinue onward, however, the mountain peaks will\nprobably be covered with loose gravel and stones,\nfor little grows on the windswept, sun-scorched terrain. For every three steps you take upward, you will\nslip backward one. At any moment, the entire slope\nmight coming sliding down on top of you, burying\nyour entire party under tons of dirt and rock. If the\nmountainside is not covered in gravel, chances are\nthat youre climbing a cliff of solid stone. You must\nIn either case, as you shoulder your burdens and\nstart to climb foot-by-foot up the steep slopes, this is\nwhere you will feel the worst effects of the mysterious\nmountain-sickness. Breathing will become difficult,\nyour head will pound with pain, you will feel sick to\nyour stomach, and you will feel tired and listless. In\nserious cases, you may even lose all desire to continue your journey and turn back for no reason you\ncan name, or even sit down and wait for the freezing\nembrace of the night, when the temperatures will\nplunge far below zero.\nThe realization will come slower to those who have\nbeen traveling along the ridgetops. They will notice\nthat the slopes are growing steeper, the precipices\ndeeper, cliffs more frequent. Their pack animals, if\nthey still have any, will grow nervous and afraid.\nEven the docile kanks will refuse to move, and, if\nthey are somehow forced to continue forward, the\npoor beasts will inevitably lose their footing on the\nsheer slopes and fall to their deaths-strewing all\nthat they were carrying as they tumble thousands of\nfeet down the mountainside.\nThose who have been traveling in a gulch or a\ncanyon will have no doubt when this moment has\narrived. They will find themselves standing at the\nbase of a sheer wall rising thousands of feet into the\nsky. There will be no easy way to continue forward.\nIf they have somehow managed to bring pack animals this far, the gravel-covered slope, the huge\nboulders looming overhead, and the intermittent\ncliffs will leave no doubt that the only way to continue is climbing on their own feet.\n60</p>\n<p>be sure of every step, always securing every move\nwith a good handhold, for one slip will send you\nplummeting thousands of feet. Even if you friends\nbother to descend the mountain and are lucky\nenough to locate your remains, all they will find is a\npummeled mass of flesh.\nThe one good thing about the mountains is that\npredators will not be as great a concern as they are\nin the canyons. Few land animals have any desire or\nreason to journey into the mountains, so the only\nhazard will come from large flying creatures that\nmay be looking for an easy meal. Usually, the purpose of their attacks is not so much to kill you directly as to cause you to lose your footing and\nplunge to your death. In fact, they seem to prefer\nmeat that has been tenderized in this fashion. I once\nsaw a wyvern ignore several pounds of freshly killed\nerdlu in order to knock a man off the mountainside,\nthen fly down and feast on the pulverized body.\nFlora and Fauna\nVegetation is not common on the rocky slopes of\nthe high mountains, but here and there, the gnarled\ntrunk of a six-foot ranike tree snakes out of a crack\nin the cliffs. While there is nothing edible about this\ntree, when burned, its sap gives off an aromatic fragrance that is repugnant to insects, including the\nrugged thri-kreen.\nThe only animals you are likely to encounter on\nthese slopes are flying reptiles and birds of prey, all\nof which take advantage of the security offered by\nthe rocky heights to make their nests. Needless to\nsay, they do not appreciate having their territory violated.\nThe Forest Ridge\nAs the traveler crests the summit of the Ringing\nMountains, he sees what is perhaps the strangest\nsight on Athas, and one that will assuredly take his\nbreath away. Below him, a jungle of tall fir and\nbirch trees covers the steep slopes of the high mountains, with a thick undergrowth of rhododendron\nand mountain bamboo. It stretches north and south\nalong the spine of the mountains as far as the eye\ncan see. This is the legendary Forest Ridge, the paradise at the top of the world.\nFor some reason, a wide band west of the summit\nof Ringing Mountains is surprisingly moist. Nearly\nevery morning, a gentle drizzle falls, and at night\nthere is sometimes an inch or two of snow. Predictably, this more-or-less constant supply of moisture\nhas resulted in a green-belt unlike anything else on\nAthas.\nAs the traveler enters the forest, he quickly discovers that the vegetation is so thick that he must\ncut a path through it. The forest grows dark and\ngloomy, and it is filled with the chortles and cries of\nhundreds of small animals alarmed at the intruders\npresence. Overhead, the wind whistles through the\ntreetops with an eerie ringinghence the name of\nthe range.\nAlthough the mountains on this side of the summit are as steep as those on the eastern side, the\nfooting is much less treacherous. The loose gravel\nhas been replaced by a carpet of moss that clings to\na thick layer of black  soil. The slopes are still steep,\nthe cliffs are just as rocky, and the abysses just as\ndeep, but they are hardly visible behind the green\ncurtain of vegetation.\nThe most amazing thing about this forest is the\nhumidity. Beads of water cling to everything: tree\nleaves, rocks, even your forehead. The gentle murmur of tiny brooks comes from all directions, here\nand there becoming a small roar as a stream plunges over a precipice and crashes onto the rocks at its\nbase far below.\nEven in this paradise, you still will suffer from\nmountain-sickness. The slightest exertion still fatigues you and your head still pounds, but at least\nthe thick canopy of the jungle provides some shelter\nfrom the sun.\nAt night, the forest remains surprisingly warm,\nalmost as if the thick canopy were acting like a\n61</p>\n<p>blanket to insulate the ground. The temperature\ndrops, lingering a little bit above or a little bit below\nfreezing but does not plunge anywhere near the extremes experienced on the barren eastern slopes of\nthe mountains.\nYou mustnt linger in the forest, however, unless\nyou have come here to die. Surprisingly, the greatest\nthreat does not come from animals. The jungle is\noccupied mostly by small animals that rely upon\npoison to defend themselves, and they wont bother\nyou if you dont bother them. The predators are not\ngenerally dangerous to men, either; they tend to be\nsmall and feed almost exclusively on the lesser creatures inhabiting the forest.\nIt is the halflings that you must watch out for.\nThey consider anything that enters their territory\nincluding other intelligent racesfair game. Once\nthey become aware of your presence, they will silently stalk you through the forest, awaiting just the\nproper time to spring ambush. If possible, theyll\ntake you alive and present you as a gift to their king.\nShould you be taken alive, this is not a fate you\nshould hope for. Some halfling kings are so savage\nthat they prefer to eat humans and demihumans\npresented to them alive. Others are more civilized,\nand will at least have the decency to kill and cook\ntheir meals first.\nIf a traveler cannot be taken alive, the halflings\nwill be just as content to drive him over some cliff,\nambush him during his sleep, trick him into trusting\nthem by pretending to be friendly, or simply overwhelm him with superior numbers.\nIt should be noted that any halfling with the adventuring party will be spared if at all possible. Even\nif the halfling is dressed the same as his companions, the natives will assume he has been captured\nand is being held against his will by the big people. Protests and entreaties on behalf of the rest of\nthe party will have no effect, as the savage halflings\nwill simply assume that their unfortunate brother\nhas been magically seduced into defending his companions. After the brother has been freed, he\nwill be invited to join the tribe or be released with an\narmful of gifts to go on about his business.\nFor more information on halflings, see Organization of Villages and Hunting and Gathering Clans\nin Chapter Two: Society on Athas.\nFlora and Fauna\nThere are so many trees, vines, and shrubs growing on the Forest Ridge that it is futile to try to describe them all. Suffice it to say that there are\nhundreds of mighty trees, all covered with lush\ngrowths of huge leaves, bearing strange and exotic\nfruits. From their branches dangle more kinds of\nvines than I could catalog in a lifetime. The floor of\nthe jungle is so thickly covered with green shrubs\nand brightly colored flowers that the ground itself\ncan only be glimpsed on rare occasions.\nThe fauna of the jungle is as amazing as the flora.\nA thousand species of snakes, frogs, birds, and little\nrodents scurry about your feet. Occasionally, you\nwill also glimpse one of the great, dark predators\nthat lurk in the depths of the jungle-but so briefly\nthat you will not be able to say that you saw any\nmore than a dark shadow. Be forewarned, however;\nin the forest, just because something is small does\nnot mean that it is not deadly. Poison is so common\nin this jungle that it is a wonder you can breathe the\nair without inhaling some foul toxin.\nRuins\nThe Ringing Mountains have their share of ruins, though sometimes of peculiar sorts.\nThe canyons and gulches are, for the most part,\ndevoid of any ruins. Whether this is because the ancients did not build there or because the flash floods\nhave washed away all signs of their presence is impossible to know. Suffice it to say that if you are\nsearching for lost treasure, dont bother looking in\nthe canyons.\nThe spires and ridges of the foothills are dotted\nwith crumbling towers, abandoned keeps, and\n62</p>\n<p>forgotten castles. Usually, these lonely edifices stand\natop a peak or knoll overlooking what must have\nonce been a point of some strategic importance,\nsuch as the junction of two large canyons or the narrow entrance of a particularly long gulch. Sometimes, the foundations and dungeons below these\ncastles still contain a few pieces of steel armor, a\nmetal sword, or some other forgotten treasure. Just\nas often, they now serve as the stronghold of a powerful raider chieftain or monster tribe.\nIn the foothills, there are many natural caverns of\nincredible scope and size. Usually, they are inhabited by a wide variety of nasty creatures, but some of\nthem house incredibly beautiful scenes and vast\npools of water concealed in their depths. It is occasionally worth the risks involved to sneak into one of\nthese caverns just to see what you can see.\nThe mountains and foothills alike are laced with\nancient mines. For all but dwarves and halflings,\nmine tunnels too low to walk in comfortably; in fact,\nhalf-giants and many elves must crawl on their hands\nand knees to explore these places. Some people claim\nthat this is because halflings were once expert miners\nwho dug most of the tunnels in the Ringing Mountains, but Im not sure I believe this. Whoever dug\nthe mines did a poor jobor else age has taken its\ntoll on their craftsmanship. I have heard tales of mine\nentrances collapsing unexpectedly, leaving a party of\nexplorers trapped inside and suffocating. Some\nmines are filled with water, and as you move through\nthem you must be careful not to step into a hidden\npit, or to open a door that will unleash a torrent of\nfoul-smelling water that burns your skin like acid.\nOther mines, I have been told, are filled with explosive gas, so that when you carry a torch into them,\nthe air itself erupts into flame.\n6 3</p>\n<p>Add to these dangers the usual assortment of\nhorrors lurking in dark caverns, and strange races\nof dark-dwelling humanoids said to inhabit the\nmountain tunnels, and the mines seem to be very\ngood places to avoid. Of course, I realize that many\nof you reading these words have heard the tales of\nunderground cities and treasures hidden in these\nmountain mines, but just remember that neither\nwealth nor fame does a dead man any service. That\nis all I will say on the matter.\nFinally, the strangest ruins of all can only be\nfound high in the mountains. Every now and then,\nyou will come across a strange, dilapidated building\nstill clinging to the side of a high cliff, or tucked\naway in a deep crevice halfway down a thousandfoot abyss. These tiny buildings are large enough to\nhold no more than two or three people, and can only\nbe entered at considerable risk by climbing a sheer\nface of rock or lowering oneself several hundred feet\non a rope. They seldom contain anything of economic value, but I have known clerics and druids\nalike who have spent a day or two there and emerged with new insights on the nature of the world\nthat have allowed them to increase their powers significantly.\nMeetings\nIf you intend to travel into the Ringing Mountains, be prepared to fight for your life one minute\nand run for it the next. About the only friendly people that you will meet are the herders grazing their\nanimals on the sandy heaps at the mouths of the\ncanyons. Otherwise, the inhabitants of the mountains are there either in search of privacy, or because\nit is a good place to hunt. Neither group is likely to\nwelcome visitors.\nOccasionally, you may discover a merchants\ntrading post hidden away in some gulch, near a rock\nquarry or possibly even a mine. Unless you work for\nthe same house, and are bringing him supplies,\ndont expect a warm welcome. Any merchant outpost in such an out-of-the-way location is a sure inAlmost any normal method of travel should work\nwell in the level plains of the Hinterlands: walking,\nkank riding, or even a mekillot wagon. Unfortunately, unless you can think of some way to get a\nkank or mekillot across the Ringing Mountains\n(and believe me, I have tried or heard tell of every\nTravel in the Hinterlands\nAt first glance, the Hinterlands are not very different from the Tablelands. After descending the\nwestern slope of the Ringing Mountains and working your way across the miles of sand heaped at the\nmouths of the canyons, you will come to a flat, empty plain that stretches out toward the horizon as far\nas the eye can see. You have reached the Hinterlands.\nThe Hinterlands is that area which lies beyond\nthe Ringing Mountains. I must confess that I know\nlittle of this region, for my journeys have taken me\nless than a hundred miles into it. In my defense,\nhowever, let me point out that I am the only person I\nknow who has ever journeyed there and returned.\nTo my knowledge, all others who have set out to explore this region have simply disappeared.\nThe Hinterlands\nOn the other hand, there is little need to fear that\nhe will ambush or otherwise assault you; all merchant codes strictly forbid using violence to weed out\nthe competition. Of course, if you can prove that\nyou are not a competitor, and offer to swear a satisfactory oath never to reveal the outposts existence,\nthe agent may be inclined to receive you as a guest\nor customer. Of course, once you have proven that\nyou do not belong to another house, his obligated to\navoid violence no longer applies.\ndicator that something in the vicinity is of economic\nimportance. Most likely, the resident agent will assume you are scouting for a competitive house and\nwill do nothing to make your job easieror even to\nsave your life.\n64</p>\n<p>technique I know) youll end up walking. Youre\nabout as likely to find a domesticated beast of burden here as you are to survive a battle with the dragon. The Hinterlands remain completely deserted;\neven if youre carrying money or goods which with to\nbarter with, youll find no one from whom you can\npurchase an animal.\nFortunately, the flat terrain is conducive to foot\ntravel. After leaving the narrow band of stony barrens (see below), youll be able to make good time.\nThere will be enough foliage so that you can forage\nfor food without too much effort, even if you dont\nalways recognize the plant that youre eating. I advise you to be careful of anything with crimson\nleaves, however; after eating the root of one of these\nplants, for two days I thought I could fly. (Its a good\nthing I wasnt in the mountains.) Game will be also\nbe plentiful, if you feel like risking a hunt.\nI would advise you to be careful about water, however. Although oases are a little more common in\nthe Hinterlands than in the Tablelands, you wont\nknow their locations, and there are no well-traveled\npaths to give you clues as to where you should look.\nThe best option is take along a cleric of the Water\nPlane as a traveling companion. Barring this, I\nwould suggest never traveling so far away from your\nlast watering hole that you cannot return to it with\nwhat you have left in your waterskins. I suspect that\none reason travelers dont return from this region is\nthat hidden oases are more common and, they\ndont follow this advice.\nGeography of the Hinterlands\nFrom my experiences, the Hinterlands have much\nin common with the Tablelands, save that they are\ndevoid of intelligent races as we know them. Therefore, the descriptions below are brief, describing only aspects which are unique to the regional terrain of\nthe Hinterlands. If you need to know more about\nthe basic nature of a particular type of terrain, or\nthe flora or fauna found there, see Geography of the\nTablelands in this same chapter.\nStony Barrens\nWhen you reach the base of the Ringing Mountains western slope, it will appear that the Hinterlands are nothing but a vast plain of stony barrens.\nDont despair; the stony plains are only a narrow\nband, between five and thirty miles wide. In the\nworst case, it shouldnt take more than three days to\ncross them.\nYou may stumble across a well-worn path leading\naway from the foothills of the Ringing Mountains.\nThough the walking will be much faster and easier\non this path, avoid it at all costs. The path has no\ndoubt been made by large animals that roam back\nand forth between the foothills and the scrub plains\nbeyond. Even if you dont encounter a herd or pack\nof these beasts, which will no doubt be ferocious,\nyou are likely to be attacked by the fierce predators\nthat have learned to lie in ambush along such\nroutes.\nScrub Plains\nMost of the ground that I have seen in the Hinterlands is composed of scrub plains. Compared to\nthose of the Tablelands, these plains are unusually\nflat; except for bushes and the occasional tree, they\nare as level as a tabletop. Unfortunately, the gentle\nbreeze which always seems to be blowing stirs up a\nlot of dust, so a gray-green haze clings to the\nground, limiting visibility to a half mile or so.\nThere are vast numbers of animals in the scrub\nplains, most of whom show two-legged creatures no\nspecial diffidence. As you travel, you will no doubt\nrun across feral herds of erdlus, wild mekillots, untamed kank hives, and dozens of creatures that you\nwill not recognize at all. If they do not flee from you,\nthen you would be well advised to flee from them.\nRocky Badlands, Mountains, & Forest\nThe only terrain of this type that I encountered\nwas the Dragon Crown Mountain; see this entry in\nChapter Four: Atlas of the Tyr Region.\n65</p>\n<p>Ruins\nMeetings\nI ran across little sign of the ancients in the HinThe only encounters I had were with wild beasts; I\nterlands.

In Dark Sun, this means a\nwizard must be either a defiler or a preserver.\nRogue Classes\nThe defiler is a wizard who activates tremendous\nmagical energy without regard to its effect on the\nenvironment. With the casting of each spell, a defiler destroys a portion of the worlds ecosystem, rendering it dead and sterile. The means by which a\ndefiler learns and uses magic is comparatively easy\nto master, so he advances quickly. A defiler can be\neither a noble, freeman, or slave.\nThe preserver attempts to use magic in concert\nwith the environment. Learning how to wield such\nmagic on Athas is especially difficult, so the preservers advancement is slow. A preserver can be either a freeman or slave.\nThe illusionist is a specialist wizard who wields\nmagical illusions. An illusionist can be either a preserver or a defiler, and will advance in levels accordingly. An illusionist can be from any social class.\nPriest Classes\nThere are three types of priests on Athasclerics,\nThe Psionicist Class\ntemplars, and druids.\nThe cleric is a free-willed priest, tending the needs\nof the local people with his particular talents. On\nAthas, clerics draw their magical energy directly\nfrom one of the four elemental planes: earth, air,\nfire, or water; not from any manner of deity. A cleric\nmay be either a freeman or a slave.\nThe templar is a regimented priest devoted to a\nsingle sorcerer-king. Such disciples work within the\nhierarchy of that particular sorcerer-kings clergy,\nadvancing in power and position. A templar draws\nhis magical energy through his sorcerer-king. A\ntemplar can be either a freeman or a noble.\nThe druid is a priest tied to a particular feature or\naspect of Athas. Unique geographic features are\nguarded by spirits when druids serve. For example,\na pooled oasis has its own spirit and a single druid\nwill reside there to protect it and preside over its use\nby humans, demihumans, and animals. Druids can\nbe from any social class.\nAthas is a world of corruption and power where\nrogues are well-suited to success. There are still\nthose, however, who use their disreputable talents\ntoward noble ends, but they are especially rare.\nThere are two types of rogues on Athas: thieves and\nbards.\nThe thief is a rogue whose strengths lie in stealth\nand pilfering. On Athas the thief can be regarded\nas a talented individual for hire-some city states do\nnot even consider the thief as a wrongdoer; only the\nperson who hired him is guilty of a crime. The thief\nmay also be a simple robber seeking personal wealth\nor redemption. A thief can be from any social class.\nThe bard is a rogue who uses songs and tales as\nhis tools. He is a man of wit and comradeship. With\nfew other talents to offer, the bard is still a welcome\nsource of entertainment and information across\nAthas. A bard can be from any social class.\nThe psionicist uses the forces of his own mind to\naffect his environment. Psionic powers are not magical in nature, that is to say, psionic powers do not\ndraw upon magical energy that surrounds all things.\nRather they are derived from within when the\npsionicist has his entire essence in coordination; his\nmind, body, and soul in perfect harmony. Since psionic powers are not magical, they in no way affect\nthe worlds ecosystem when they are used.\nAny human or demihuman character who meets\nthe ability requirements may elect to be a psionicist.\nHowever, those who do not choose the psionicist\nclass will have latent psionic powers. Every player\ncharacter in Dark Sun has latent psionic powers\nand will be a psionicist or wild talent.

Rather,\nthey start with a fair degree of experience.\nStarting Level\nIn Dark Sun, all single-classed player characters\nstart the campaign at 3rd level. A player character\nthus begins his adventuring career with the minimum number of experience points to attain 3rd\nlevel. He gets the THAC0 and saving throws of a\n3rd level character, plus any class or race benefits\nthat apply. This rule reflects the fact that daily life\non Athas is much harsher than it is in other\nAD&D® realms, forcing characters to mature more\nquickly if they are to survive.\nStarting Hit Points\nBeginning characters determine their hit points in\na fairly normal fashion. Roll a hit die for each of the\ncharacters first three levels of experience, apply any\nConstitution modifications to the rolls, and then total them to determine starting hit points.\nStarting Proficiencies\nStarting player characters receive their initial\n21</p>\n<p>weapon and nonweapon proficiencies, plus the additional slots due at 3rd level. Thus, warriors receive\nan additional weapon slot (5 total) and an additional nonweapon slot (4 total) for being of 3rd level.\nWizards and priests receive an additional nonweapon proficiency (5 total) for being of 3rd level.\nFor those not used to this system, remember that\nthe Number of Languages column from Table 4:\nIntelligence in the Players Handbook indicates a\nnumber of bonus nonweapon proficiency slots.\nStarting Money\nPCs who start the campaign as freemen have\nthree times the starting money stated in Chapter 6:\nMoney & Equipment of the Players Handbook.\nMulti-classed Player Characters\nPlayer characters who are multi-classed start adventuring in the campaign at different levels. The\ncharacter begins with just enough experience points\nto be 2nd level in his most expensive class.\nFor example, a fighter/preserver would have\n22\n2,500 experience points in each class, the minimum\nto be 2nd level as a preserver, letting him start the\ncampaign at 2nd level in each class. A fighter/\npreserver/thief would al so have 2,500 experience\npoints in each class, which is enough to make him\n2nd level as both preserver and fighter, but enough\nto let him start the campaign as a 3rd level thief.\nNon-player Characters\nWhile player characters start the campaign at\nhigher levels, NPCs can still be 1st or 2nd level, as\ndetermined by the DM. Thus, it is important to realize that the PCs are truly exceptional individuals\nand that lower-level NPCs will be fairly common.\nClass Descriptions\nThe complete character class descriptions that\nfollow provide detailed information about each\nclass. Those unique to Dark Sun are detailed fully\nwhile those that are found in other campaigns are\npresented so that the contrasts to similar characters\nin other settings can be made clear.\nWarriors\nThere are no paladins in Dark Sun-the idea of\nserving good and right for the simple rewards of inner peace and faith faded from the barren world of\nAthas long ago. There is, however, one new warrior\ncharacter class: the gladiator. Born of a demand for\nblood and excitement in the arenas, gladiators are,\nperhaps, the most deadly fighting characters.\nFighter\nAbility Requirements:\nStrength 9\nPrime Requisite:\nStrength\nAllowed Races:\nAll\nOn Athas, the fighter is a trained warrior, a soldier skilled in mass warfare. Every society on Athas\nmaintains an army of fighters to protect itself from\nattack or to wage wars of plunder and annihilation</p>\n<p>against its neighbors. Fighters are both the commanders and soldiers in these armies, and at higher\nlevels are experts in both individual and formation\ncombat, leadership, and morale.\nFighters can have any alignment, use magical\nitems, and gain weapon proficiencies and specialization as described in the Players Handbook.\nAs a fighter increases in experience levels, his reputation as a warrior and leader of men grows. As\nword spreads, less experienced warriors who are eager to fight for the same causes will seek him out.\nThese followers will remain loyal to the fighter for as\nlong as they are not mistreated and there are battles\nto be fought. A fighter need not have a stronghold\nto attract followers.\nFollowers are always gained in groups of 10 individuals called a stand. All 10 are of the same race\nand experience level and have the same equipment.\nA unit consists of some number (usually 2-20) of\nidentical stands.\nOnce a fighter reaches 10th level, he attracts his\nfirst unit of followers. This first unit will always be\nmade up of warriors of the same race and background as the fighter (if the fighter is a slave tribesman, so will be his first unit of followers). The first\nunit will consist of 1d10+2 stands (30-120 individuals). Roll 1d2+1 to determine the level of the\nunit.\nAs the fighter gains each new level beyond the\n10th, he will attract another unit of followers. Roll\ndice to determine the number of stands in the unit\nand the level of the followers. These subsequent followers, \nthough, \nmay \nbe \nof \nvery \ndifferent \nbackgrounds than the fighter himself.\nA fighter cannot avoid gaining followers.

In the\ncourse of a campaign, a player who wishes to roleplay the situations might raise huge armies of former slaves or gain control of an entire thri-kreen tribe.\nA fighter has the following special benefits:\nA fighter can teach weapon proficiencies when he\nreaches 3rd level. The fighter can train students in\nthe use of any weapon in which he is specialized.\nThe fighter may train a number of students equal to\nhis level in a single class, and a class requires 8\nhours of training each and every day for one month.\nAt the end of that time each student must make an\nIntelligence check; those who pass gain a bonus proficiency slot in that weapon. A student may only be\ntrained once, regardless of success, with a specific\nweapon. Students can learn any number of new\nproficiencies in this manner, even beyond those slots\nnormally allowed for a character of that level.\nA fighter can operate heavy war machines when\nhe reaches 4th level, including bombardment\n23</p>\n<p>engines (like ballistae, catapults, and trebuchet),\ncrushing engines (like rams and bores), and siege\ntowers.\nA fighter can supervise the construction of defenses\nwhen he reaches 6th level. These include ditches and\npits, fields of stakes, hasty stone and wooden barricades, and even semi-permanent stone fortifications.\nSpecific rules governing the construction of these defenses are presented in Chapter 9: Combat.\nA fighter can command large numbers of troops\nwhen he reaches 7th level.

A gladiator character may specialize in any\nnumber of weapons, provided he has the number of\n2 4</p>\n<p>proficiency slots required.\nA gladiator is an expert in unarmed combat. He\nreceives 4 point modifier to punching and wrestling\nattack rolls, which he can use as a plus or a minus to\nhis roll after it is made. The gladiator may consult\nthe Punching and Wresthng Results Table in the\nPlayers Handbook while ma king this decision.\nA gladiator learns to optimize his armor when he\nreaches 5th level. He conditions himself to use his\narmor to its best advantage, dodging and moving\nhis body in such a way that opponents are confounded by his armor and shield. Provided the\ngladiator is wearing armor, his armor class is reduced by one for every five levels (-1 at 5th-9th\nlevel, \n-2 \nat \n10th-14th \nlevel, \n-3 \nat \n15-19th \nlevel,\n-4 at 20th level).

For instance, human rangers are very often former slaves\nforced into the desert wilderness for simple survival.\nHalfling rangers, on the other hand, are an integral\npart of their aboriginal society, serving as advisors\nand trackers. Whatever their origin, all rangers are\nof good alignment, living rugged lives through clever\nmastery of their surroundings.\nA ranger can use any weapon or wear any armor,\nand he can fight two-handed, just as described in\nthe Players Handbook.\nA ranger also gains the tracking, move silently,\nand hide in shadows abilities as described in the\nPlayers Handbook.\nAn Athasian ranger must also choose a species\nenemy, gaining attack adjustments against them\n(consult Chapter 11: Encounters for a list of possible species enemies).\nA ranger is skilled at animal handling.

A ranger never\ngains bonus spells for a high Wisdom score, nor is\nhe ever able to use clerical scrolls or magical items\nunless specifically noted otherwise.\nWhile a ranger cannot enchant magical potions\non his own, he can reproduce them using botanical\nenchantment (see Chapter 10: Treasure).\nAt 10th level, a ranger attracts 2d6 followers, but\nhis followers are far different from those granted to a\nfighter or gladiator.

The rules governing\nthis process are given in Chapter 7: Magic.\nA defiler who has an intelligence score of 16 or\nhigher gains a 10 percent bonus to all experience\npoints earned. A defiler can use any magical item\nnormally available to wizards.\nJust like preservers, defilers can opt to specialize.\nSpecialist defilers are treated as explained in the\nPlayers Handbook.\nDefilers are wizards who have decided to take a\nfaster, darker approach to mastering the use of magical spells. In the give and take of spell casting, defilers are well versed in the taking, but give nothing in\nreturn. With every spell cast, a defiler leeches the\nlife-energy out of the plants and soil around him,\nleaving a lifeless zone. Because of this, defilers can\nonly have non-good alignments.\nAbility Requirements:\nIntelligence 9\nPrime Requisite:\nIntelligence\nRaces Allowed:\nHuman, Elf, Half-elf\nAll wizards in Dark Sun use spell books and\nmemorize their spells, just as explained in the Players Handbook.

A sorcerer-king\ntolerates a select few defilers in his employ, to carry\nout day-to-day magical tasks that he has no patience\nfor. These defilers are always at the beck and call of\ntheir master, and the sorcerer-king himself oversees\nthe training of new recruits. The sorcerer-kings defiliers are feared and hated far and wide.

Powerful\nsorcerer-kings often masquerade as gods and demigods but, though their powers are great and their\nworshippers many, they are not true gods. The\nworld does, however, provide sources of magical\npower. Such belief-inspired magic is separated into\n2 8</p>\n<p>three distinct areas, each with a class of priest that\nspecializes in its application.\nTemplars worship the sorcerer-kings and draw\ntheir magical energies through them. The sorcererkings grant magical spells to their templars for services rendered. If a templar falls from favor with his\nsorcerer-king, or if his sorcerer-king is killed, the\ntemplar looses all magical spells.\nClerics worship one of the four elemental planes:\nearth, air, fire, or water. They call upon magical energies from those planes, specializing in one elements magical applications on the prime material\nplane.\nThe spells available to a cleric depend upon his\nelemental plane of worship. To reflect this, the\nspheres of clerical spells have been altered-there\nare only five spheres: the Spheres of Earth, Air,\nFire, Water and the Sphere of the Cosmos (a general sphere). A cleric gains access to all spells within\nCleric\nhis chosen elemental sphere and to all spells in the\nSphere of the Cosmos.\nThe spells themselves are received directly from\nthe elemental sphere (even the Cosmos spells). A\ncleric need not restrict his activities to supporting his\nelement on Athas, but direct opposition may cause\nspells to be withheld, at the DMs option. For example, a cleric of the water who goes out of his way\nto poison or otherwise damage a watering hole\nmight suffer for this action.\nsphere of the cosmos. Templars can have access to\nany sphere, but their spell progression is slower than\nnormal. Druids choose their spheres based upon\nthe geographic feature with which they are associated. The new lists of priest spells by sphere is given\nin Chapter 7: Magic.\nOtherwise, priest characters are created and used\njust as described in the Players Handbook. They\nuse eight-sided Hit Dice and can gain additional\nspells for having high Wisdom scores. Restrictions\nto armor and weaponry vary actor ding to class.\nThe use of priestly magic never adversely affects\nthe ecosystem in and of itself. The net result of the\nspell may affect the environment (such as summon\ninsects or lower water), but the use of the magical\nenergy itself entails no destruction akin to the unleashing of a defilers magic.\nAbility Requirements:\nWisdom 9\nPrime Requisite:\nWisdom\nRaces Allowed:\nAll\nDruids associate themselves with the spirits that\ninhabit special geographical locations on Athas\nevery oasis, rock formation, stretch of desert, and\nmountain has a spirit that looks over it and protects\nits use.

This choice will dictate what\nspells he can call upon and what types of weapons\nhe will prefer to use. A cleric has major access to the\nsphere of his element of worship. He also has minor\naccess to the Sphere of the Cosmos.\nOutside the city states, away from the bureaucracy of the sorcerer-kings and their templars, the most\ncommon type of priest is the cleric. All clerics worship the elemental planes and draw their magical\nenergies directly from them. However the backgrounds and motivations for clerics may be vastly\ndifferentthe shaman witch doctors of the halflings, the mullahs of the trader caravans, and the\nhealers among the slave tribes are all very different,\nbut theyre all clerics,\nSpheres of Magic\n2 9</p>\n<p>The shape of the gated material may be dictated\nby the cleric (a stone wall one inch thick, a sheet of\nflame surrounding the altar, etc.), but it cannot be\ngated more than 50 feet from the cleric.

The duration of\nthis power is a number of rounds equal to his level,\nand it can only be performed once per day. Thus, a\ncleric of water may move through water freely and\none of earth may pass through stone walls as if they\nwere not there. Force exerted on the cleric by the\nelement may also be ignored-a great wind will not\naffect a cleric of the air, flames will not burn a cleric\nof the flames.

Middle-level templars (levels 5-8) gain greater\nresponsibilities and may have several lower-level\ntemplars beneath them. High-level templars (levels\n9 and higher) move into management of the city\nstate-such templars are difficult to unseat, since\nDruids as NPCs\nthey can blame nearly any shortcomings on their\nunderlings.\nThese are only a sampling of the many levels of\ntemplar bureaucracy. Advancement through the\nranks has little to do with ability or experience.\nTechnically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his\nown city and the templars assure him of worship and\nobedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god\nor a demigod, though he is generally an extremely\npowerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to\nworship him. There isnt a noble, merchant, or\npeasant in a city state who doesnt at least pay lip\nservice to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.\nThe DM must keep two things in mind when\ndealing with any particular templar NPC. First,\nhow will the templar attempt to use the player characters to gain advantage? He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of\na superior, or he could buy their services to perform\na task such as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider\nhow the player characters might appeal to the templars wicked ways and greed. In their quest for\npower, they are sometimes easily manipulated.

Hunting on their lands or using\nits timber for equipment is, to the druid, part of the\nnatural order of things and he wont interfere.\nIrresponsible use of his guarded lands, however,\nwill bring him out into the open with full force.\nHunting his lands until there is no game left or\nstripping the vegetation will cause the druid to take\naction.

I\nhave come to the conclusion that the ancient societies\nwould have considered this mine too worthless to operate. In our age, however, it is a treasure trove that has\nprovided the sorcerer-king of Tyr with wealth and\npower almost unmatched in the world.\nUnfortunately, metals are rare. In my voyages I\nhave been lucky enough to actually see the iron mines\nof Tyr, something few outsiders are ever permitted to\nMetal isnt strictly necessary for any Athasian\nculture to survive, but its a great benefit to those\nthat have it. Hunters know that metal arrowheads\nand spearheads are sharper and more enduring\nthan those made of stone or bone. With metal\nshoes, herders can protect the feet of their mounts\nfrom the rigors of the desert wastes. City dwellers\nuse metal to fashion tools that make backbreaking\nfarm work easier and more efficient. Metal even facilitates commerce between societies, for merchants\nand traders use it as a universal currency.\nBarrenness\nSurprisingly, all of these societies are shaped by\nthe same four forces: barrenness, shortage of metal,\npsionics, and magic. If you understand how any society deals with these forces, you will understand the\nsociety itself.\nthere are groups of people. Each has found a different key to survival in this harsh world. Sometimes\nthese different bands coexist peacefully; more often,\nthey clash whenever they meet.\nMetal\ncontrols the food and water forms an elite class. The\nbest stalkers, the wisest herders, or the people who\nown the farms and wells are always influential and\npolitically powerful members of the community.\nGiven the importance of food and water on\nAthas, it shouldnt surprise any of us that whoever\nIn my travels I have found that Athas is a world of\nclashing cultures.

Nomadic herders clog\nthe trading roads with their unruly flocks, slowing\neven the fastest merchant caravan to a crawl. To\nkeep from being massacred in their sleep, villagers\nworking the mines of the Ringing Mountains buy\noff feral halfling tribes with worthless glass baubles.\nOn Athas, there are as many different societies as\nmeager crops.

I have never seen such a thing\nmyself, but if such treasures exist, they will reward\nthose who find them most handsomely. Those who\ncontrol such stores of metal can buy food, power,\ninfluence, and sometimes even the sorcerer-kings\nprotection.\nIn war, the advantages of metal are also plain.\nTyrs army has never numbered more than ten\nthousand, but its elite units are composed of highly\ntrained men, each of whom carries a steel sword and\nan iron-tipped javelin. Often it has destroyed an army five times its size that was armed with bone battle\naxes or even obsidian-edged sabers!\nPsionics\nFrom the lowliest slave to the most powerful\nWho can doubt that Athas would be a very different place with an abundance of metal?

Virtually every individual has some\nmental ability, although in many the true strength of\ntheir psionic potential remains unrealized.\nEach culture values its psionic members. To the\nraiding tribes, individuals with clairvoyance are especially useful for locating targets. The nomads, for\nexample, value an individual who can pinpoint the\nbands position in the desert.\nAs I have stated earlier, it is my belief that metal\nwas not always scarce on Athas. For the last few\ncenturies, our main source has been debris from the\nruins of ancient castles and cities. Apparently, our\nancestors devoured Athas ore supply, leaving to us\nlittle but their scrap. Now, even that meager supply\nis all but exhausted, and with it fades the ghost of\ncivilization. There are those who say that our cultures and technologies can survive without metal,\nbut I believe that they are wrong.\nPsionic powers are not always beneficial. They\ntend to be destabilizing and turbulent. There are\nalways thieves who will use their psychokinesis to\nsteal the property of a fellow tribesmen, and power\nhungry nobles who send assassins trained in psychometabolism to murder their rivals. Rebellious subjects can always find a use for nearly any psionic\nability, and in seemingly peaceful villages? many sordid and disgraceful acts are carried out behind curtains of psionic deception.\nStill, lucky treasure hunters have been known to\nreturn from a ruin with a hoard of steel swords and\nshields, providing they are resourceful enough and\nbrave enough to explore ruins that others have\nmissed or been too frightened to enter.\nI have heard tales that suits of clothing fashioned\nfrom metal have even been found from time to time.\nIt is generally agreed that these were worn by warriors to protect against the blows of enemy weapons.\nI can only speculate that the climate must have been\nfar cooler in those ancient days. Any fool that would\nwear such clothing now would die faster from heat\nstroke than he would have from the weapons of his\nfoes. Still, the idea that there was once enough\nmetal in the world to allow such a garment to have\nbeen manufactured astounds me.\nConsidering the potential psionic offer powers for\namassing power and wealth, it should not surprise\nyou that most cities have at least one school devoted\nto the Way-of the Mind. These schools are run by\nmasters of the psionic arts, often with the stated purpose of helping the individual better understand his\nown potential and the responsibilities it entails. In\nreality, they are usually expensive academies for the\nsons and daughters of the wealthy, designed to develop the students psionic powers to their full\npotential-with the explicit goal of gaining an advantage over their political rivals in later life. It is no\n9</p>\n<p>Despite their efforts, leaders seldom monopolize\nmagic. There are always at least a few individuals in\nany society who practice it secretly. Of course, these\nnot the art of replacing it.

Defilers are a blight\nupon our world. They are the fiends who have deCasting a magical spell requires energy. The\npower for a spell must come from somewhere, and\nthere are two means of fueling ones magical endeavors on Athas. One is harsh and destructive,\nfurthering the downward spiral of life on our world.\nThe other is positive and beneficial, halting the effects of this ecological entropy for a while. Those\nwho employ the first type of magic are called Defilers, while those who employ the latter variety are\nPreservers.\nDefilers learn to draw magic from the land, but\nSorcerer-kings send their agents to destroy potential rival wizards hiding within their cities. Nomad\nwitch-lords banish rival mages to the unforgiving\nsands of the desert. Halfling chiefs exterminate followers who show any sign of control over the supernatural. Even otherwise timid hermits have been\nknown to risk their lives in an effort to make sure\nthat no wizard enters their territory.\nBecause magic is so powerful, every ruler controls\nit tightly. For the most part, it is impossible to maintain control of a populace dotted with numerous psionic individuals if one is not also a wizard. Thus,\nnearly every ruler on Athas is a wizard of some type,\nusually a Defiler.\nLife Energy and Magic\nMagic is arguably the mightiest force in Athas.\nThose wielding it call fire storms out of a calm sky,\nchange one object into another, or kill enemies with\na mere gesture. They dictate the wills of entire\nmobs, make the dead walk, and have even been\nknown to stop time. Magic can expose traitors, destroy rivals, and exact unquestioning obedience\nfrom subjects. It can also conceal secret activities,\nuncover the kings spies, be used to assassinate royal\nofficers, and foster general rebellion.\nThe Veiled Alliance\nPreservers reinvigorate the soil after they drain it\nto power their spells. As Preservers learn their craft,\nthey also learn to rekindle the spark of life. When\nthey cast a spell, they replace what they have taken\nthrough a combination of natural and mystical\nprocesses (such as by working compost into the soil\nor by performing the Rite of Blood in the field they\nhave drained). Preservers learn their spells and master their art more slowly than Defilers, for they must\nlearn to give as well as take. Unfortunately, Preservers are scarce compared to Defilers, and it is a\nrare person who understands the difference between\nthe two.\nMagic\nPsionics has often been called a great equalizer in\nthe brutal world of Athas, for it gives even the most\nphysically weak individual a chance to compete and\nsurvive.

In most cases, it stays barren for\ndecades. The spark of life can be returned to the\nground through hard work and tender care, but few\npeople can afford to take the time required to do so.\n10</p>\n<p>In most cities (and many villages, tribes, and\nclans), there are secret leagues of Preservers called\nthe Veiled Alliance. The Veiled Alliances are confederations of Preservers working together to protect\ntheir members from assassination and harassment\nby sorcerer-kings and other lieges. The members\nwork together to shield each others identities from\nthe authorities or to help those who have been discovered to escape persecution. They are often involved in plots to overthrow their oppressive\noverlords.\npowerful people are almost always the hand-picked,\nloyal followers of the leader.\nThe Preservers with whom I have spoken say that\nthere are only two drawback to belonging to a Veiled\nAlliance. First, membership is permanent. When you\njoin one of these secret organizations, you pledge to\nuphold its charter until death. Anyone failing in this\npledge is cast out, and the alliance assigns one of its\nmembers usually someone experienced in such matters) to assassinate the outcast. This seems rather severe to those of us in the rank of the uninitiated, but it\nis a condition of affiliation that all members agree to\nwhen they join the alliance.\nSecond, all Veiled Alliances require that their\nmembers be Preservers and not Defilers. The reason for this is practical, not idealistic: even a few\nmages will decimate a small area if they do not practice their art responsibly. Any violation of this principle always results in the banishment (and\nsubsequent execution) of the Defiler.\nFrom what I can tell, although each league goes\nby the same name, they are in fact separate organizations. Most follow the two principles outlined\nabove, and will extend their protection to a member\nof an alliance from another city (providing adequate\n11</p>\n<p>proof of affiliation is provided). At the same time,\nthey must be on constant watch for spies, for most\nrulers will stop at nothing to uncover and destroy an\nalliance operating within their territory. For this reason, punishments are sure and swift in any Veiled\nAlliance. Everyone with whom I have spoken agrees\nthat it is better to err on the side of security than to\nrisk exposing the entire society.\neconomy, architecture, and general culture vary according to the tastes of the citys ruler and the needs\ndictated by survival.\nIn austere Balic, where hungry giants raid semiweekly, every citizen is a skilled and fearless soldier.\nAt the other extreme is decadent Tyr, where slaves\noutnumber citizens two-to-one. Gulg can hardly be\ncalled a city at all, lacking a single stone building\nand standing hidden behind a wall of thorny hedges\nand poisonous vines.\nThe Worst Scourge\nAs bad as they are, Defilers are not the worst of\nmagics blights. Compared to the dragon, even\nsorcerer-kings are babes toying with a dimly understood gift. The dragon wields sorcery powerful\nenough to crush entire cities, and so destructive that\nwe must measure the devastation caused by its spells\nin square miles.\nDespite each citys unique character, however,\nthey all respond to the rigors of barren Athas by\norganizing in the same general manner. Perhaps\nthis is an accident of history, or perhaps survival\nmandates this type of organization; I dont pretend\nto know. All I can say is that this is what I have seen\nin my travels.\nAnything that crawls or walks or flies trembles at\nthe mere sight of the horrid beast, for the dragon\ndraws its magical energy from animal life. When it\ncasts its spells, any creature from whom it draws energy collapses in its tracks, dying before it hits the\nground. In addition, the dragon can store magical\nenergy in its body for use at a later time. This gives it\nthe freedom to use its spells in even the most barren\nof wastes and the incentive to roam over wide expanses of desert in search of food.\nThe Sorcerer Kings\nEvery city is led by a king. He (or she) may be\naddressed as Magnate in one place and Vizier in another, but is always the absolute dictator\nof his subjects.\nKings are at the top of the social order. They live\nnear the center of the city in a fortified palace bustling with minor officials. When a potentate finds it\nnecessary to leave his palace, he does so only with a\ngreat deal of preparation and pomp, well-protected\nby magic and his full bodyguard. If this cannot be\narranged, he will not leave (except in the most dire\nof emergencies). The last thing any king of Athas\nwants is to walk unprotected among his subjects.\nBeing a wanton user of magic, the dragon preys\nupon anything that can feed its ravenous appetite\nfor energy. When the horrid beast is about, caravans of withered corpses line the trading routes.\nWhole herds of desiccated erdlus rest alongside\ntheir shepherds. in blackened fields of dead saltbrush. Entire villages lie smashed and flattened, the\nbodies of the inhabitants strewn about the streets\nlike refuse. No society, from the smallest family of\nAl most without exception, every king is a powerful Defiler who has risen to his position through the\nunprincipled use of magical and psionic abilities.\nAll monarchs jealously guard the use of magic and\nemploy a sizable force of templars whose sole duty it\nis to ferret out and execute unauthorized Preservers.\nIn every city that I have visited, the kings are especially anxious to infiltrate agents into the Veiled Alliance, as an organization of Preservers presents a\nviable challenge to their magical power base.\nThe City States\nEach city state is different. Its laws, customs,\nhunters to the largest, most crowded city-state, is\nsafe from the dragon.\n12</p>\n<p>Templars are the guardians of reading and writing. Because knowledge is power and the most effiAll kings take the matter of famine seriously, however. When a citys population starves, one of two\nthings happen: a terrible revolt breaks out or disease\nand pestilence run rampant through the streets. In\neither case, the slave population plummets. Untended fields go barren, fortifications fall into disrepair, and the city grows weak. Therefore, most kings\ntake quick and decisive action when famine begins:\nthey raise armies and go to another city-state, steal\nits food, and replenish their supply of slaves.\nBecause starting a war is the typical response to a\ncitys internal problems, I have never heard of a\nsorcerer-king who does not take the matter of security\nfrom external attack seriously. All kings maintain\nstanding armies, they usually have some large defenIn return for his exalted position and unlimited\nauthority, the king has the duty to administer justice, protect the citizens from famine and crime, and\nsafeguard the city from external attack. In practice,\nthese gluttonous monarchs spend most of their effort protecting their power base and seeing to their\nown comfort. Justice tends to be self-serving and arbitrary, and the kings agents are so corrupt that\nthey often ignore crime altogether-providing the\ncriminal pays them a large enough bribe.\nAs agents of their monarchs will, templars are\nfeared and despised by common city-dwellerswith\ngood reason, if you ask me. These priests abuse\ntheir positions steadily, enforcing the kings edicts\nwith spiteful indifference, taking bribes, and dealing\nout unjust punishments to anyone who objects.\nGenerally, complaints about the bureaucracys corruption fall on deaf ears, for the templars are any\nsorcerer-kings best means of maintaining a stranglehofd on the population.\nThese greedy templars dominate the kings bureaucracy. Although each city organizes its agencies differently, every bureaucracy is steeped in\nancient traditions designed to promote the organizations welfare and keep it tied closely to the monarch. Templar bureaus tend to be permeated by\nintradepartmental treachery and embroiled in external political intrigues with other agencies of the\ncitys bureaucracy.\nTemplars are clergymen devoted to the sorcererking of their city. Like other priests, they are granted\nspells in return for their worship. Unlike true\npriests, who draw their power from the elemental\nforces of the world, Templars tap into the magical\nforces of their sorcerer-king. When a templar beseeches his monarch for a spell, the sorcerer-king\ngrants the request by employing his own mystical\nenergy to power the templars magic. Because of the\nstrain this places on both the sorcerer-king and the\nsurrounding land, young templars do not ask for (or\nreceive) many spells. As close personal servants of\nthe sorcerer-king, however, high-ranking templars\nhave greater access to magic than one might expect.\nThe king is sometimes considered his citys deity.\nHis priests force the citizens to build temples to the\nking and lead them in pompous ceremonies of worship. Sometimes, the nobles and a few wealthy citizens consider the king their benefactor. Never,\nhowever, are other classes misled by such pretensions. The merchants see the king for what he is-a\ncenter of political and magical power that must be\nappeased if they are to continue their commerce in\nhis city. If the ranks of slaves see the king as a god, it\nis certainly as an evil and corrupt one that keeps\nthem in bondage and makes a misery of their lives.\nsive project under construction, and I have heard that\nthey devote most of their magical research to developing spells to fend off enemy armies. In fact, most cities\nare so well defended that it is impossible to criticize any\nsorcerer-king on this basis.\nThe Templars\nEvery king uses his magic to prolong his life, and\nmost have reigned for hundreds of years. Many\nhave reigned for more than a thousand years, and\none or two are even credited with founding their ancient cities.\n1 3</p>\n<p>cient way of passing on knowledge is through writing, no one but templars and nobles are permitted\nto read and write. One of the most sacred duties of\nthe templar bureaucracy is to prevent the knowledge\nof this art from spreading beyond their own ranks\nand that of the nobility. Most kings have authorized\nthem to execute on the spot anyone else demonstrating any knowledge of these critical skills.\nwith the young men of the family serving as officers.\nIn an emergency, the king can freely call upon these\narmies to supplement his own troops.\nTemplars are commonly recruited from the offspring of other templars, or from the ranks of\nfreemen. Technically, a member of the nobility may\nalso join the kings bureaucracy, but most aristocrats consider such positions beneath their honor.\nAs you might expect, the nobles sometimes turn\ntheir armies on each other or the templars, but never\nthe sorcerer-king. The kings magic is usually more\nthan sufficient to deal with the use of force, and any\nfamily foolish enough to challenge him in such an obvious fashion suffers terrible consequences.\nLike the templars, the nobles are permitted to\nread and write, and they are usually equally vigilant\nabout protecting this critical secret.\nThe Nobility\nThe Freemen\nThe nobles control the farms and the water of the\ncities. Usually, each noble family picks a senior\nmember to sit on a parliamentary council. In theory,\nthese councils act as advisory bodies to the monarchs, but in reality they are little more than administrative bodies through which the king passes his\ncommands to the aristocracy.\nPut simply, freemen are citizens of the city who\nare not owned by the king, the templars, or the nobility. By virtue of their birth status, they have the\nright to reside within the protection of its walls and,\ntheoretically at least, to enjoy the benefits of its laws.\nBut if a freeman cannot pay his debts, exhibits\nknowledge of reading, writing, or magic, or undertakes some other forbidden activity, he is judged to\nIt is not rare, however, for the interests of the nobles to be opposed to those of the templars and/or\nthe kings. On such occasions, the advisory councils\nsometimes find the courage to voice their opposition. When this happens, a flurry of political assassinations usually follows. Most people assume that\nthese assassinations are carried out by the templars\non their own initiative or at the kings request.\nThe bulk of freemen are craftsmen and artisans\nbe in violation of the kings edicts. The templars\nhave the right to (and almost certainly will) seize him\nand sell him into slavery. This practice is a source of\nconsiderable income to many templars.\nThough the nobles sometimes gather the courage\nto oppose the templars, or even the king, dont\nmake the mistake of believing that they have the best\ninterests of the city populace at heart. As a class,\nthey are interested only in preserving their hereditary land rights, and they form the largest block of\nslave-owners in any city.\nwho keep their shops within the city walls. Heavily\ntaxed by the king and harassed by the corrupt templars, they are generally ill-contented and suspicious, but too cowardly and intimidated to openly\nresist their tormenters.\nLess common in the class of freemen are the clerics. Clerics are priests who worship the elemental\nplanes and draw their magical energies from them.\nIf their devotion allows them to live in cities, they\nmake a nice living by selling their services as healers\nor workers of minor miracles. Templars tend to regard these true priests with suspicion and animosity,\nthough most have learned that it is wiser not to harass a cleric.\nNo matter how opposed the nobles might be to\nthe kings policies, they can always be counted on to\nprotect the city (as invasion would strip them of their\nlanded rights). For this reason, every family is allowed to maintain a standing army of slave soldiers,\n1 4</p>\n<p>mail one merchant, they will find that everything\nthey wish to buy from other merchants has inexplicably doubled in price or vanished from the\nmarket.\nMerchants\nEvery city serves as the headquarters for at least\nhalf-a-dozen merchant houses, and several times\nthat number maintain trading emporiums within\nthe city walls. Usually, these trading emporiums are\nlocated in a particular quarter of town, where a purchaser can buy nearly anything that Athas has to\noffer if he knows where to look.\nTechnically, merchants are not permitted to read\nor write, but they are allowed to keep accounts. I\nshould note that most houses have highly developed methods of keeping accounts. For all practical purposes, most merchants can both read and\nwrite in the secret language of their houses. Not\nsurprisingly, jealous templars spend a considerable\namount of energy trying to prove to the king that\nthe keeping of accounts is, in fact, a form of reading and writing.\nMerchants are not citizens, for the nature of their\nwork dictates that they maintain contact with a wide\nvariety of societies (which makes our sorcerer-kings\ndistrustful). Instead, merchants are granted longterm licenses to reside in a city, and in return they\ndonate large sums of money to public works (i.e., to\nthe sorcerer-king).\nFor additional information on this subject, I have\nincluded a more complete description in the section\nentitled Merchant Houses later in this chronicle.\nMerchants are one of the few classes that the bureaucracy is careful not to harass. The templars\nhave learned that if they try to intimidate or black15</p>\n<p>Elven Merchants\nSome elven tribes earn their livelihoods as traders.\nUsually, they are less established than the merchant\nhouses, so they sell their wares in crowded bazaars\nlocated on the edges of the true merchant quarter.\nElves have a reputation for smuggling and selling\nbanned goods such as spell components. (By the\nway, if you expect a merchant to guarantee his\nproduct, it is best not to buy from an elf).\nperched high above the arenas, often wager considerable sums on the outcome of these battles. More\nthan one noble has been sold into slavery for not\nbeing able to pay the debts he incurred when a favored gladiator fell.\nSlaves\nA person can become a slave in one of three ways:\nThe best of these gladiators are muls (pronounced: mül), a tough crossbreed of human and\ndwarf. They retain the height, dexterity, and cunning intelligence of their human side, but are also\ngifted with the durability and strength of their dwarven parent. From their dwarven line, they also inherit a certain single-mindedness which makes them\nvicious fighters.\nStanding over six feet tall, muls weigh two hundred to three hundred pounds, have hairless coppery skin as tough as gith hide, and tend toward\nintrospective, gruff dispositions. They are born sterile and cannot reproduce their own kind.\nby being born a slave, by being captured during a\nwar or other armed conflict, or by being sold into\nslavery for committing some crime or failing to pay\nones debts.\nA member of any race or social class can become\na slave, though nobles and merchants usually have\nfriends or family who will buy their freedom for\nthem. It is also rare for elemental clerics or mages to\nbecome slaves, as they can usually escape easily. Instead of selling such individuals into bondage, prudent templars simply execute them when they\ncapture them.\nDespite their combat abilities, muls dont make\ngood soldiers. In addition to being very expensive to\nbuy or breed, muls are intelligent enough to recognize when their officers are making a mistake and\nstubborn enough to refuse foolish orders.\nArtists\nWe can take one bit of solace from the institution\nof slavery, however: there are a surprising number of\nformer templars in their ranks. The losers of the political infighting in the kings bureaucracy are often\nsold into slavery. Templar slaves are generally the\nsubject of abuse and ridicule by their newly established peers and generally die quickly as a result of\nsome tragic accident.\nIn most Athasian cities, the arts are appreciated,\nbut not as highly regarded as many feel they should\nbe. Although templars and nobles alike enjoy being\nsurrounded by artistic creations, none of them\nwould ever trouble to create such a thing themselves. Therefore, all arts are entrusted to slaves.\nThere are several classes of slave: gladiators, artists, soldiers, laborers, and farmers.\nGladiators\nThe wealthiest templars and most noble families\nmaintain stables of men and women picked and\ntrained for their fighting prowess. These slaves are\nsent to fight in the gladiatorial stadiums for public\nentertainment. Their owners, sitting in private boxes\nOne of the best ways for a slave to elevate his position is to develop and demonstrate some sort of artistic ability, such as singing, reciting poetry,\npainting, sculpting, and so forth. If he or she has\nenough talent, a noble or templar will purchase the\nslave and treat him to a life of pampered luxury. In\nexchange, the owner expects the slave to produce\nbeautiful work which will impress his friends. (I\nmust note that because of the dubious tastes of nobles and templars, many artists must compromise\ntheir artistic vision in order to stay alive.)\n16</p>\n<p>In most cities, it is common practice to secretly\nteach valued slaves the art of reading and writing, so\nthat they may read the words of the masters and\nrecord their own observations for the owners next of\nkin (this is how I came by the art myself). For the\nartists, there is only one drawback to this privilege:\npopularity is a fickle thing, and most artists fail out\nof favor within a few years of their success.\nWhen that happens, those who have been taught\nhow to read and write suffer one of two fates: their\nowners either have them executed for knowing how to\nread and write, or they are sent to the gladiatorial pits\nas fodder. It is no wonder that many artists, upon sensing their popularity beginning to wane, plan elaborate\nescapes and flee into the desert as I did.\nSoldier Slaves\nBoth sorcerer-kings and the noble houses maintain standing armies of slave soldiers. The quality of\nthese soldiers varies widely. In most cases, they are\nsimply burly slaves who have been taken from the\nfields, equipped with some manner of weaponry,\nthen taught to fight as a unit. To keep these soldiers\nin line, officers rely on a combination of privileged\ntreatment and harsh punishments.\nThe best armies of the noble houses are selected\nas infants, removed from their parents, and raised\nby officers. During their harsh childhoods, these\nchildren learn two things: to be loyal to their owning\nfamily, and to fight without regard for themselves.\nIn order to ensure that the armies of their nobility\nare not a threat to their own power, many sorcererkings raise armies of half-giants. This powerful race\nwas created by the magical crossbreeding of humans\nand giants and their strength can put even a powerful mul to shame.\nTo oversee these half-giant troops, the monarchs\nrely upon hand-picked templar officers who use their\nmagical abilities to keep the brutes in line. Noble\nhouses never use half-giant soldiers, for they lack the\nmagic necessary to keep such troops under control.\nIf an overseer sees a slave touch his mouth without\npermission, he whips the man mercilessly. If he\ncatches a slave stealing food or water, he cuts off the\nthiefs hand. When a slave loses both hands, he can\nno longer work and is put to death.\nThe only consolation in the farmers life is that\nwhen a tribe of raiders attacks, or when a flock of\nwild erdlus races through a field, he can sometimes\nescape into the desert. Whether or not this is an\nimprovement is hard to say, but the desire for freedom often outweighs the urge to live.\nAt least half of any citys slave population are\nfarmers owned by the nobles. These starving dregs\nlabor in the fields around the city, working the soil,\ncarrying water, digging up man-choking vines, and\npicking poisonous insects off crop leaves.\nFarmers\nThe ranks of the laborers are dominated by\nstrong races such as dwarves, half-giants, baazrags,\nand muls too old or maimed to fight in the gladiatorial arenas.\nGenerally speaking, slaves owned by the freemen\nare well-fed and cared for, for they are an investment\nthat the owner does not care to squander. Laborers\nowned by the king, however, are fed barely enough\nto keep them alive, and once they prove too weak to\nwork, they are executed. As agents of the monarch,\nthe templars can always procure more slaves by arresting minor law-breakers or vagrants.\nEvery city has a large force of laborer slaves.\nAbout half are owned by enterprising freemen who\nmake their livings building homes, shops, merchant\nemporiums, and other private structures. The other\nhalf are usually owned by the monarch, overseen by\nthe templars, and spend their time building and\nmaintaining various public structures such as\nbridges, temples, and city walls.\nLaborers\n1 7</p>\n<p>Wizards\nDespite the persecutions of the templars and the\nsorcerer-kings, every city has its share of wizards. Of\ncourse, you will never meet one who openly admits\nto his art, but there are nevertheless mages in every\ncity.\nDefilers\nCities are the hardest places for inexperienced\nDefilers to survive. Not only are they hunted by the\nagents of the monarch, but few citizens will provide\nthem with refuge or assistancein addition to fearing the kings wrath, most people resent what the\nDefilers magic does to the land. For this reason,\nmost Defilers lead solitary lives of constant apprehension, associating only with the shady elves who\nsell them spell components.\nThe Veiled Alliance\nMages have life a little easier. As members of the\nVeiled Alliance, they have a network of friends and\nallies to whom they can turn when they need support. The alliance helps them procure spell components\nwithout exposing their identities to\nuntrustworthy elves, warns them about nosy templar\nagents, protects them from psionic and magical\nprobes, and helps them escape the city if they are\ndiscovered.\nJoining a Veiled Alliance is no easy matter, however. From what I understand of the organization in\nTyr, for example, before a Preserver is asked to join,\na current member must propose to the entire organization that they extend an invitation to the prospective associate. If any of the current members\nstates a reason for excluding the candidate, he is not\ninvited to join. Only after all the members have\n18</p>\n<p>been polled and no one objects does the proposing\nmember extend an invitation to the candidate. Such\ninvitations are seldom refused, for by the time a Preserver is offered membership in the Veiled Alliance,\nhe is well aware of the benefits it can provide.\nAfter we sat down, we were approached by a\npsionicist. This woman asked us several questions,\nand all the while I could feel her probing our minds\nfor lies. At first, I thought that she found our answers unsatisfactory, for she simply stood and left\nwithout saying a word. A short time later, however, a\nwaif came to our table and informed us that a guide\nwas waiting for us. This guide took us to the home\nof a high-ranking Alliance member, who acted as\nour host and protector while we were in the city. He\ndid not introduce us to any other members of the\nAlliance, and, though he treated us courteously\nenough, I was aware that if we had acted in a manner that could be considered even slightly suspect,\nwe would have been killed in our sleep.\nAs a courtesy, most Veiled Alliances extend their\nprotection to Alliance members from other cities.\nOnce, I was in the company of an Alliance member\nwhen he requested such a courtesy. First, we sought\nout a tavern that we had heard Alliance members\nfrequented. As we entered, the Preserver covered\nthe lower part of his face with his hand. This did not\nappear to be so much a secret password, however, as\nan indication that we were looking for a member of\nthe citys Veiled Alliance.\nIn most city-states, there is no distinction made between the positions which men and women may hold,\nfor both sexes seem equally capable of the treachery\nrequired to attain and hold power. At least two\nsorcerer-kings are in fact sorcerer-queens, and women rise or fall as fast as men in the ranks of the templars. Many noble houses are represented on the\nmonarchs advisory council by matriarchs, and the\ncontrol of most merchant houses passes to the eldest\ncompetent child, whether it is a son or a daughter.\nGender in the Cities\nEven in the ranks of slaves, sex makes little difference. Women fight as gladiators and soldiers alongside their male counterparts, and artists are treated\nthe same no matter which sex they are. About the\nonly place where gender makes any difference is in\nthe lowest rank of slavery, where there is a slight\npreference to make males laborers due to their slight\nadvantage in strength.\nRace in the Cities\nAlthough racial dispositions tend to group humans and demihumans along class lines, this is not\ndue to any sort of bigotry. In no city that I have been\nto is there a policy, official or otherwise, that excludes any race from membership in any organization or group. There are dwarven templars, elven\nnobles, human gladiators, and halfling craftsmen.\nIn short, a member of any race can hold any position, provided he has the necessary talents and\nskills.\nThis is certainly not due to any benevolence or\nsense of justice on the part of the sorcerer kings. I\nsuspect that it has more to do with the fact that such\nprejudices are a foolish waste of valuable resources.\nHowever, this is not to say that all races are equally represented in all classes of society. Every race has\ncertain dispositions that suit it for certain positions\nin society. The following paragraphs list the occupations which each race commonly pursues in a city.\nHumans\nHumans are the most common and versatile of all\nthe races. They are typically found in any position,\nfrom sorcerer-king to farmer. Compared to dwarves,\nmuls, and half-giants, they are not very strong, so\nthere are less of them in the ranks of soldier-slaves\nand laborers than their proportion to the total population might indicate. Humans have a talent for\ntreachery and political intrigue, so they form a clear\nmajority in the ranks of templars and nobles.\n1 9</p>\n<p>short-lived templars and aristocrats, and most people are far too cautious with their wealth to buy anyDwarves\nDue to their strength, dwarves make good laborers, soldiers, and craftsmen, so there tend to be\nlarge concentrations of them in these classes. However, if a dwarf sets his mind to attaining a certain\nposition, he can overcome nearly any barrier to his\nsuccess through sheer determination. I have met\nhard-working dwarves in the ranks of the templars,\nnobility, artists, and gladiators.\nElves\nMost elves found in the cities represent their\ntribes in the trading bazaars. They are expert bargainers, but are also extremely unreliable to anyone\nexcept members of their own tribes. Elves usually\navoid slavery by fleeing at the first sign of trouble,\nbut when forced into bondage, they make excellent\nfarmers (provided their owners can keep them from\nrunning away), and are often selected as artists due\nto their ability to flatter potential patrons. Though I\nhave never frequented the Games, I understand\nthat elves also make interesting gladiators, winning\ntheir victories through speed and stealth where their\nopponents rely on strength and endurance.\nHalf-elves\nCity-born half-elves are rarely accepted as members of their elven parents tribe, for their human\nhalf makes them suspect to the clannish minds of\nelven tribesmen. At the same time, they suffer from\nthe reputation for deceit and unreliability that taints\nelven merchants. Therefore, most half-elves grow as\nloners, learning quickly to rely only on themselves\nand to take advantage of others to get what they\nwant. These traits serve them well in the ranks of the\ntemplars. When sold into slavery, they either convince their owners that they have hidden artistic potential or find themselves working in the fields as\nfarmers.\nThese giant, intelligent insects are not common in\ncities, for their lives are devoted to the hunt and they\npossess only a dim understanding of human society.\nNevertheless, they are sometimes taken as slaves. In\nthis case, they serve as laborers or farmers, but never as soldiers (they are known to turn on their masters, and any man who trusts one with a weapon is\nconsidered a fool). Occasionally, when its pack has\nbeen destroyed, a thri-kreen comes into a city of its\nown free will. In these cases, it either seeks out a\nposition as a templar assassin or volunteers its\nservice as gladiator on behalf of some lucky noble.\nThri-kreen\nBy their very nature, all muls are born into slavery\nfor the purpose of gladiatorial training. If they prove\nunsuitable for this purpose, their strength usually\ncommands a good price as a laborer. Occasionally,\nmuls win or purchase their own freedom. When this\nhappens, they make excellent templars. Similarly,\nthey can always find ready employment as an elite\nmercenary, in the permanent guard of a noble family, or a merchant house sentry cadre.\nMuls\nthing that a half-giant craftsman makes. Therefore,\neven if born into freedom, the unfortunate members\nof this race find it difficult to make a living as an\nhonest freeman and usually find themselves bound\ninto slavery. They are generally purchased either by\ncraftsmen in need of strong laborers or by templars\nfilling a half-giant regiment for the king. Occasionally, half-giants manage to retain their freedom for a\nfew years by hiring themselves out as mercenaries.\nBecause of their limited intellectual capacity, halfgiants do poorly in positions of power. They make\nHalf-giants\n20</p>\n<p>Halflings\nHalflings are rare in cities, for they are possessed\nof a personality even more feral than that of the thrikreen. When taken as slaves, they are usually\ntrained for the gladiatorial arena as a curiosity, for it\nis well-known that they die quickly in bondage.\nHalflings who have been cast out of their own tribes\nwill serve nobles as hunting guides or craftsmen as\nstonechippers, but only if their freedom is in no way\nimpinged and in return for room and board only\n(they view wages as a form of slavery).\nVillages\nIn your travels, youll find villages scattered all\nover Athas, from islands in the Sea of Silt to peaks\nhigh in the Ringing Mountains. Usually, they stand\nat some site of moderate importance, such as a minor oasis, the crossroads of two trading routes, or\nnear a flint or obsidian quarry. They consist of a few\ncrudely built structures erected within a small area.\nSome villages are surrounded by a stone wall or a\nthorn-hedge stockade, but all are located in the\nmost defensible position possible. Several times a\nyear, the villagers will be called upon to defend their\nhomes from beasts, raiders, or monsters, and they\nrealize the advantage terrain can provide. No matter how carefully defended a hamlet is, however,\ndont count on it existing for very long. Sooner or\nlater, its defenses will fail and the inhabitants will\nhave to flee or die, abandoning their shabby homes\nto the desert.\nClient Villages\nThe largest, best equipped villages are sponsored\nby the city-states, usually because there is something\nin the local area that is of importance to the city.\nTyr, for example, sponsors a village at the site of its\niron mine, and Urik maintains a sizable town near\nthe obsidian quarries of the Smoking Crown.\nOccasionally, some interest other than a city also\nsponsors a village. For instance, the merchant\nAs we all know, slave escapes are far from rare on\nAthas. Those who survive inevitably find their way\nSlave Villages\nUnlike most other hamlets, when a client village is\ndestroyed, the sponsor generally rebuilds it as quickly as possible. Oft en, to prevent such a holding from\nbeing looted repeatedly, the sponsor also goes to\nconsiderable effort to track down and eliminate the\nforce that ruined the village in the first place.\nClient villages are rarely self-sustaining. They\nusually draw their water from a local well or spring,\nbut they must rely upon shipments from their sponsors for food and other supplies. Often, enemies\nfind it easier to destroy the village by cutting off\nthese supply lines than by attacking the village itself.\nCompared to cities, these hamlets are culturally\nbackward. When visiting them, you will find only\nthe barest necessities and no amenities. The Veiled\nAlliance is rare in client villages, for most hamlets\nare so small that it is impossible for a mage to hide\nhis presence for long. Where the Alliance does exist, it is only because the members are powerful\nenough that the authorities feel it would be more\ntrouble to smash than it is worth. The other inhabitants of villages are mostly desperate and rough individuals whose favorite pastimes are far from\nconducive to the public peace. The governors authority over the inhabitants is enforced by virtue of\nthe garrison he commands.\nThe leader of most client villages is a military governor assigned by the sponsoring agency. In the case\nof city-run villages, this leader is usually a moderately powerful templar of proven loyalty to the\nsorcerer-king. Other sponsors usually rely upon a\nPreserver or Defiler as the commander. The governor is assisted in his duties by subordinate officers\ntemplars if a city is sponsoring the village,\nmercenary fighters if someone else is sponsoring it.\nhouses of Wavir, Rees, and Tomblador in the city of\nBalic protect a critical junction along their trading\nroutes by sponsoring the fortress village of Altaruk.\n2 1</p>\n<p>to one of the hundreds of slave groups hiding in the\nmost forlorn parts of the desert.\nBecause slaves are not well equipped to survive\nthe rigors of the desert, most bands form raiding\ntribes (described later). These tribes make their bases in villages located in the most miserable,\ndifficult-to-reach parts of the desert. If you happen\nto stumble upon a slave village, you wont be allowed to leave without first becoming a tribe member, and you wont be asked to become a tribe\nmember unless you can prove youre an escaped\nslave or will perform some great service for the tribe.\nThe only alternative to membership, however, is a\nslow and lingering death in the desert.\nThe leaders of slave villages are usually the best\nmilitary thinkers, which means these hamlets are\ndominated by soldiers or gladiators. Wizards or extemplars-turned-slave never serve as leaders, for the\nMany escaped slaves were once artists, so most\nslave hamlets have a rich cultural life. Should you\nvisit a slave village, you will no doubt find brilliant\nmasterpieces of sculpture and painting in ramshackle huts, and be entertained at night by poetry\nDespite unpleasant associations with the sorcererkings, slaves realize what wizards can do to protect\nthem. Therefore, wizards and sorcerers are more\ntolerated in slave villages than anywhere else. Usually, however, a hamlet has only one type of wizard:\neither Preservers or Defilers. The friction caused by\nthe two different approaches to magic is destructive\nto village harmony.\nslaves are too wary of magical power to trust such\nmen in positions of leadership. No matter who leads\nthe community, however, he must be careful not to\nbe seen as a dictator. The slaves are quick to overthrow anyone who limits their freedom.\n2 2</p>\n<p>recitations, concerts, and plays.\nMost slave villagers are truly thankful for their\nnewfound freedom, so you will note a certain blissful\natmosphere in the community. At the same time,\nyou had better be aware that there is also an undercurrent of barbarism that could explode into violence at any moment. Many ex-slaves are gladiators,\nsoldiers, and other rough sorts who believe that the\nbest way to resolve differences is with the sharp end\nof a dagger.\nWhether artist or gladiator, all the inhabitants are\npainfully aware that slave-takers from a nearby city\ncould appear at any time, so they live with only one\ngoal in mind: to enjoy what time they have to the\nfullest.\nDwarven Villages\nYou will find dwarven villages in any place\ndwarves have a reason to gather for a common purpose. Dwarves wishing to build a toll-bridge have\nestablished villages on isolated banks of dust fjords.\nOthers, convinced that hidden seas lie under the\nGreat Ivory Plain, have founded a hamlet in the\ncenter of the vast salt flat to drill for water. Still others, determined to restore the lost City of Dwarven\nKings to its former glory, have built their village in\nthe middle of the vast expanse of sand that long ago\nburied the ancient metropolis.\nThe leader of most dwarven villages is the person\nwho first devoted himself to the idea that is the focus\nof the towns existence. All of the other dwarves look\nto him for guidance and planning, executing his\nmost tentative suggestions as if they were commands. If the leader of the village dies, then leadership is passed on in descending order of arrival. The\ndwarf who joined the project second becomes the\nnew leader, then the one who joined third, fourth,\nand so on.\nIn these villages, dwarven culture, what there is of\nit, centers on the family. When the dwarves are not\nworking toward achieving the communitys focus,\nthey are caring for their families. Relations between\nthe families are generally close and friendly, their\nties strictly regulated by a code of honor. Although\nit is extremely rare for a dwarf to break this code,\nthose who do are banished from the village. If you\never visit a dwarven village, be sure to ask for a recitation of its code of honor as soon as you reach the\noutskirts, or you may find yourself entangled in a\nblood feud with an entire community of stubborn\ndwarves.\nThere is no Veiled Alliance in any dwarven community, and wizards are not tolerated within their\nbounds unless someone the dwarves trust will vouch\nthat the wizard is a friend of the dwarven race.\nHalfling Villages\nAs noted later (see Hunting and Gathering\nClans), most halflings wander the forest ridges\nalong the crest of the Ringing Mountains, sustaining themselves through hunting and gathering.\nGenerally, they live in small, isolated clans that ramble through a well-defined territory.\nEvery 100 days, however, these clans go to a small\nvillage abutting their territory. The village is little\nmore than a stone pyramid rising above the forest\ncanopy, surrounded by ten to twelve stone houses\nwhere the tribal chief, his wives, and high priests\nlive.\nThe chief resembles the sorcerer-king of the cities\nin that he is the absolute ruler of his territory (usually\nall the forest within fifty miles of his village), and in\nthat he is a powerful wizard. However, all halfling\nchiefs are Preservers, not Defilers, and exercise great\ncare not to destroy the forest when they use their\nmagic. For this reason, their magic tends to be much\nless powerful than that of the sorcerer-kings, and\ntheir lifetimes are limited to a normal span. Most of\ntheir powers come from their psionic abilities.\nHalfling villages serve two important functions.\nFirst, they are a neutral area where different clans\ncan meet without infringing on each others territory. Thus, this is where marriages are arranged,\ngoods are traded, and information is passed be2 3</p>\n<p>Second, a village is the chiefs home and the center of the government. When the halfling clans go to\na village, they take with them food and other items\nto sustain the chief, his family, and the advisors. Assuming the chief deems the offering adequate, he\nrewards them by bestowing upon them the rangerlike abilities that make halflings such capable\nhunters and stalkers.\ntween clans.\nAside from using his powers to help his followers\nbe good hunters, the chief also has the duty to defend his clans territories from outside encroachment. Therefore, he can conscript subjects as\nwarriors or to build communal structures that serve\nthe general welfare of entire tribe.\nThis authority is never invoked for the purpose of\nfighting or building defenses against other halflings.\nAmong all halflings, there is such racial harmony\nthat they never fight with one another. When confronted with conflicting interests, even two chiefs will\nwork together to find some compromise that serves\nboth of them.\nBefore moving on in my narrative, I must take a\nmoment to offer a warning to any reader who is contemplating a visit to a halfling village: the greatest\ngift a clan can offer its chief is a feast. And the finest\nfeast a halfling can imagine is a delicious human or\ndemi-human who has wandered into their territory\nand been hunted down.\nDynastic Merchant Houses\nMerchants are the masters of commerce. In one\nway or another, everything that a city-state needs\nand cannot produce itself must pass through their\nhands. For Tyr to trade its precious iron for ceramic\npots from Balic, a merchant must purchase the iron\nin Tyr, carry it to Balic, arrange an exchange, carry\nthe pots back to Tyr, and sell them. The merchant\nmakes a tidy profit at both ends of his journey\nwhich is only fair, when you consider the risks involved in transporting such commodities.\nMerchants are indispensable to every city, but\nthat does not make them popular. Successful merchants become incredibly wealthy, a fact that templars and nobles alike envy. A merchants business\ndictates that he ignore governmental boundaries\nand avoid political allegiances, which makes him\nsuspect in the eyes of the sorcerer- kings.\nMerchants are jealously tolerated, but never truly\nwelcomed by the upper classes. The templars grant\nthem long-term licenses to reside and do business\nwithin the city walls, but merchants are never considered citizens and are not granted the protection\nof the citys laws.\nAs a consequence of their non-citizen status and\nthe requirements of their profession, merchants\nhave developed a specialized sub-society of their\nown. They organize themselves into companies\ncalled merchant houses. These houses consist of\nsever al different branches, each designed to fulfill\none aspect of the companys needs. Most merchants\nsee no commercial value in keeping the basic structure of their organizations secret, so it is possible to\nprovide a sketch of the way most houses operate.\nHeadquarters\nMost trading houses are owned by a single family,\nwhich maintains a headquarters in its favorite city.\nUsually, it is a large, well-defended compound situated in a secure area as far away from noble mansions and templar complexes as possible. Although\nthey will not discuss the matter, we can assume that\na great deal of the familys wealth is stored in secret\nvaults within these compounds. Needless to say,\nmerchant headquarters are heavily guarded against\nboth assassins and thieves, and all of them have established sophisticated escape routes in case the\nneed arises for a sudden departure.\nThe family patriarch (or matriarch) directs the\noperations of the entire merchant house from the\nheadquarters. Agents from the houses farthest outposts are constantly entering and leaving the compound, delivering profits, collecting bonuses,\nmaking reports, receiving instructions, and attend2 4</p>\n<p>ing to every detail of business. Despite the constant\nbuzz of activity, however, the guards at the gate will\npermit only agents of the house to enter the compound. In the case of larger houses, recognition is\noften achieved through secret signals or passwords.\nMerchant houses are owned in common by all direct descendants of the founder, but control is\npassed on from the patriarch or matriarch to any\nfamily member of his or her choosing. In the most\nsuccessful of the merchant houses, the patriarchs\nare careful to choose their successors on the basis of\nability and integrity. When this is not the case, however, the rest of the owning family sometimes withdraws its support from the patriarch and chooses a\nnew oneor even allows the house to collapse.\nEmporiums\nIn addition to their headquarters, most merchant\nhouses maintain large trading emporiums in five to\nten different cities. These facilities consist of large\nbuildings where all manner of goods are stored in\nneat bins. When a resident enters one of these emporiums, an agent of the house is assigned to accompany him and see to his needs.\nIf the customer has come to sell, he will discover\nthat the agent is interested in buying almost anything. Of course, a few restrictions apply. First, it\ncannot be against the laws of the city to possess or\notherwise handle the item being offered. Second,\nthe item must be of demonstrated value to someone\nsomewhere. Finally, the resident must be willing to\npart with the item for about half of its true worth (a\nquarter if it must be transported to another city before being resold). If a deal is struck, the customer is\npaid in hard currency or goods, as he prefers.\nIf the customer has come to buy, an agent will\nlead him through the emporium and offer to sell\nhim anything in which he expresses an interest.\nGenerally, most emporiums have an ample supply\nof common items, such as tools, building supplies,\nclothes, etc., and also supply one or two types of\nrare items, such as jewelry, gems, food, weapons,\netc. Although it is possible for a customer to bargain for a lower price, most agents will not accept\nless than an items true value-and will obviously try\nfor somewhat more. Payment is accepted in goods\nor metal coin.\nMost emporiums are run by trusted senior agents\nof their parent merchant houses, if not by a member\nof the owning family itself. These agents handle\nlarge transactions themselves, and generally live in\nwell-guarded areas over, behind, or beneath the\ntrading floor. I believe, though I am guessing when I\nsay this, that operating capital for the emporium is\ngenerally stored in a secret vault located somewhere\nwithin the senior agents living quarters.\nOutposts\nMerchant houses also maintain trading posts in\nthe wilderness areas and wastelands of Athas. Such\noutposts can be found wherever there is something\nto trade and someone to trade with: in the Ringing\nMountains, where halfling chiefs exchange hardwoods for obsidian spear heads; in the rocky badlands, where thri-kreen hunters trade sacks of\nminerals for hand-carved whistles; on the banks of\nthe Sea of Silt, where friendly giants barter blocks of\ngranite for tarp-sized woolen capes.\nI have found the agents manning these trading\nposts to be the toughest and most self-reliant men\nand women employed by the merchant houses.\nThey commonly barter with the most feral and ferocious humans, demihumans, and humanoids; they\nenjoy making long journeys into the wastelands in\nsearch of new goods, and they take a great pride in\ntheir hard lifestyles.\nUnfortunately, necessity dictates that outpost\nagents be the most expendable members of a merchant house. Their facilities consist of little more\nthan a mud-brick warehouse built inside a walled\nfortification. Usually, the house employs a small\nband of mercenaries to defend it, and sometimes\neven a mage and/or a cleric, but the remoteness of\nthe outpost dictates that such forces be kept to a\n2 5</p>\n<p>minimum. Trading posts are easy marks for raiding\ntribes and hungry monsters. By no stretch of the\nimagination is it uncommon for a supply caravan to\nfind the outpost it has traveled days to reach demolished and the inhabitants slaughtered.\nCaravans\nEvery merchant house relies upon its caravans to\nmove goods from one city to another and to supply\nits trading posts. Every house has its own theory on\nthe best caravan configurations, but they all want to\naccomplish the same thing: moving cargo from one\nlocation to another as quickly as possible with the\nleast chance of it being stolen.\nSome caravans are small and swift, relying upon\nspeedy kanks to carry them and their cargo out of\nharms way. If you ever have a chance to ride with\nsuch a caravan, do so. At first, you may be hesitant\nquarters are cramped and hot, the entire wagon\nsmells of unwashed humans and demihumans, and\nOther caravans consist of a single, huge, slowmoving wagon with armored flanks, depending on\nnearly impregnable defenses to discourage attacks.\nSuch wagons are usually drawn by a pair of mekillots, cantankerous six-ton lizards with a fondness for\neating their handlers. Aside from a force of mercenary outriders, the entire caravan is carried inside\nthe wagon: drivers, guards, supplies, and cargo. At\nfirst, this might seem like an easy way to travel, since\nall a passenger need do is lounge about-but Id\nrather walk from Balic to Urik in my bare feet. The\nto mount a four-hundred pound, six-legged insect\nwith pincers the size of your legs, but you will quickly discover that these gentle beasts are excellent\nmounts. Even at their slowest pace, they move like\nthe wind. When they run, it seems youre flying.\n26</p>\n<p>the journey lasts forever.\nMost caravans take passengers, but the only cargo they will carry is that of their own merchant\nhouse. The houses are much too competitive to carry cargo for each other, or to trust their cargo to another houses safekeeping.\nThe caravans are led by a shrewd captain, often\na former mercenary or soldier hired by the house\nfor his military skills. To defend the caravan, the\nleader either hires individual mercenaries or subcontracts with a mercenary band. From the time\nthe caravan leaves one citys gate until it enters anothers, the captains word is law, and to disobey\nhis command is to risk banishment or death. No\nmatter what a captain does on the trail, only one\nthing will cause his employers to dismiss him:\nabandoning the cargo. As long as he delivers the\ngoods to their destination, the house assumes that\nhe is doing his job well.\nEmployment Terms\nIn most houses, there are four general categories\nof employees: family members, senior agents,\nagents, and hirelings.\nFamily members are, to one extent or another, all\nowners of the companies. They are usually based in\nthe headquarters and oversee the administrative operations of the house, such as the keeping of accounts, routing of caravans, and planning for\nexpansion. Often, they are also sent to run emporiums in distant cities. Of course, a family members \nrelationship with his house can be terminated only\nfor the most dreadful breaches of trust.\nSenior agents are trusted employees of the house\nand have the authority to conclude fairly large deals\nin the houses name. They are assigned to important positions requiring a fair amount of skill, such\nas running emporiums, outposts, or being caravan\ncaptains. A senior agent holds his position for life,\nand can even pass it on to a trusted son or\ndaughterthough the house patriarch or matriarch\nhas the option of replacing incompetent senior\n3. A promise to perform in the best interests of the\nmerchant house in return for a specified salary.\n4. A promise to deal honestly with stranger, friend,\nand foe alike.\n1. Recognition that by joining a merchant house,\nthe agent forsakes citizenship in any city or membership in any tribe.\n2. An oath by all members of allegiance to the merchant house.\nGenerally, Ive found that all merchant house\ncodes are designed to promote commerce and keep\nthe house out of trouble with the templars and the\nsorcerer-kings. They usually include the following\nprovisos:\nAll merchant houses abide by a strict code of ethics that applies to all employees from family member\ndown to agent. Although this code varies from\nhouse to house and is usually kept secret, it is not\nimpossible to loosen an agents tongue with a few\nfriendly tankards of ale.\nThe Merchant Code\nHirelings are people the house contracts to perform a specific service. Their relationships are usually short term, although hirelings who perform well\nare usually assured of receiving more work of a similar nature in the future.\nIt should be noted that although both outpost\nagents and caravan captains are senior agents, they\nseldom pass their positions on to children. Even if\nthey survive long enough to have families, the children are usually too wise to follow in their parents\nfootsteps.\nRegular agents, like senior agents, are usually\nlife-long employees of the house, but their employment can be terminated for just cause by senior\nagents or family members. Agents usually have\nlimited authority to conduct a specific type of business.\nagents who have risen to their positions through inheritance.\n2 7</p>\n<p>Elven Merchants\n5. A promise not to flaunt any wealth gained\nthrough employment with the house.\n6. A promise to uphold the laws of the city in which\nthe agent is stationed, and to do nothing to bring\nthe wrath of the sorcerer-king or his agents down\nupon the house.\n7. A promise to cooperate with other merchants to\nmake life very expensive for any person (this usually means templars) who unjustly imprisons,\nblackmails, or otherwise harasses any merchant.\nIn most merchant houses, violation of its code is\nsufficient reason to terminate the houses relationship with any agent, senior agent, or family member.\nMany elven tribes enrich their lives as nomads by\nbecoming merchants. As tireless runners and desert\nwanderers, they are well suited to caravan life, but\nelves are too restless to establish a permanent headquarters.\nInstead, the tribe itself serves as the headquarters,\nwith the chief acting as a patriarch. The chiefs advisory council, composed of a senior member from\neach family, handles the administrative functions\nsuch as keeping of accounts, keeping track of inventory, and setting prices.\nMost tribes are not wealthy enough to build or\nmaintain bartering emporiums in the cities. Instead,\nthey rent dilapidated buildings or erect semipermanent stalls on the outskirts of the trading\nquarter. These bazaars, commonly referred to as the\nelven market, often have unusual and rare goods for\nsale from all corners of Athas.\nIn most cities, the elven market is a disreputable\nplace. Unlike other merchants, elves abide by no\ncode of ethics. People who buy there usually assume\nthey are purchasing stolen property or goods of inferior quality. The elven market is also the primary\nsource of banned goods, such as spell components\nand other equipment necessary for a wizard to practice his craft.\nBy the time the tribe returns-anywhere from six\nmonths to several years later-these elves are more\nthan ready to leave the city and return to the wandering life. Any half-elf children that happened to\nUsually, a tribe stays at a city for only a month or\nso. Unless it leaves under dubious circumstances, a\nhandful of its members stay behind to conduct business at the bazaar. They usually live together in the\nsame building from which they conduct their business. Often, this band contains a considerable\nnumber of thieves who employ their talents to add to\nthe store of valuable merchandise that the tribe will\nsell in another city.\nfew years.\nMost templars will not admit it, but elves rarely\nremain in captivity for long. Their tribes are extremely close-knit, and they would not think of leaving one of their members in peril. To secure the\nrelease of even the lowest-ranking tribe members,\nthey have been known to offer exorbitant bribes\n(though I have yet to hear of any tribe actually paying such a debt). Most often, they simply help the\nslave escape and, if possible, assassinate the accusing templar, then leave the city with all their tribe\nmembers and omit it from their caravan routes for a\nelves are rarely concerned. They simply wait for the\nfirst opportunity to escape, then run into the desert\nand rejoin their tribe. If this proves impossible, they\nbide their time by trying to flatter their masters into\npromoting them into artistic status-which I believe\nis the reason so many noble homes are decorated\nwith tasteless paintings and worthless sculptures.\nDespite the elves expertise at deceiving (or fleeing) the templars, many of them are enslaved for\nselling banned goods. When this happens, most\nAlthough elves sell to all comers with no questions\nasked, they are adept at detecting the presence of\ntemplars and the sorcerer-kings agents (generally\nthrough the use of psionics). As a templar passes\nthrough the elven market, I have never failed to be\namazed at how quickly banned goods disappear in\nfront of him and reappear after he passes.\n2 8</p>\n<p>have been conceived during this time are left in the\ncity, as they would find an unwelcome reception\nwithin the tribe.\nOutside the city, elven merchant tribes do not\nmaintain trading posts. Instead, they conduct their\nbusiness as they wander the Athasian deserts, stopping here to graze, there to bargain, and anywhere\nto steal.\nIn most cultures, few sights are more agitating\nthan that of a tribe of elves camped nearby. The\nnext few days are certain to be filled with seedy entertainment, hard bargaining, and a small but\nsteady outflow of stolen property.\nI was once with an elven tribe when another elven\ntribe camped nearby. On the first night, my host\ntribe arranged an evening of entertainment for the\npurpose of luring the other tribe away from its\ncamp. While their guests were enjoying the party,\nmy hosts sent a contingent of thieves to rob the\nguests camp. The guests reciprocated the next\nnight, stealing back not only their own property, but\na considerable amount of my hosts (and my own)\nproperty as well.\nThese affairs continued for about a week, with the\nparties growing progressively more wild and ribald\neach night, until finally both tribes claimed that they\nhad gotten the better of the contest and parted\nways. In truth, I dont know who won the contest; I\nlost a precious rusty steel dagger and four copper\ncoins, but my share of the host tribes booty was a\nshiny helmet of bronze!\nLest anyone make the mistake of thinking it is\neasy to join an elven tribe, I should point out the\ncircumstances by which I came to be among them.\nBefore being accepted as an equal, I had traveled\nwith the tribe for two years and single-handedly\nsaved the chiefs daughter from being eaten by a\npack of wild thri-kreen. Still, the experience was\nworth the effort, hardship, and risk and I would not\nhave passed it up for anything on Athas.\nElven caravans are notoriously light and fast. The\nelves prefer to travel by foot, carrying their personal\nbelongings in a sack slung over their shoulders.\nCargo is transported on kanks, the only beasts of\nburden capable of keeping up with an elf if he\nbreaks into a full run. During my time with the\nelves, I rode a kank whenever we were on the road.\nNomadic Herdsmen\nHerdsmen live in groups called douars. Each\ndouar consists of a dozen families or so that wander\nthe desert together. They move from pasture to pasture, pausing wherever there is water and enough\nforage to feed their animals. When the forage is\ngone, they pack up their belongings and move on.\nIt is a practical impossibility for the douars to be\nmuch larger than twelve families or so. It requires\nmore than a dozen animals to sustain each family,\nso each tribe needs about 140-150 beasts to survive.\nIn most parts of Athas, this is the largest number of\nbeasts that can graze a pasture area without starving. If more than a dozen families try to live together,\nthere will not be enough forage for the additional\nanimals.\nMost herders rely upon flocks of erdlus for their\nlivelihoods. Erdlus are flightless, featherless birds\ncovered with flaky gray to red scales, weighing as\nmuch as a full-grown man and standing as high as a\ntall elf. They have powerful, lanky legs ending in\nfour-toed feet with razor sharp claws, and can run at\ngreat speeds over distances of several hundred\nyards. Their bodies are massive and round, with a\npair of useless wings folded at their sides. Attached\nto their yellow, snake-like necks are small round\nheads with huge wedge-shaped beaks. These beaks\nare equally suited for working between thorns to\ncrop forage at the roots, for piercing a predators\nheart like a spearhead, or for making a meal of unwary reptiles.\nThe first time a herder asked me to share one of\nthe gruesome birds eggs, I almost refused, imagining that the wrinkled, leathery shell could contain\nnothing edible. I couldnt have been more wrong!\nErdlu eggs are a treat not to be missed. When con2 9</p>\n<p>sumed raw, as is the custom when the tribe is on the\nmove, the red yolks have a zesty, gamey taste both\nsatisfying and invigorating. If cooked, the whites\nform a spongy cake with a rich taste not unlike\nsharp cheese. All in all, erdlu eggs are an excellent\nfood; a man can survive for months eating nothing\nelse, and by drinking them raw, he can even go for a\nweek or so without water.\nAside from their eggs, however, the erdlus provide\nthe herders with many of the other things needed to\nsurvive in the desert. When a bird becomes too old\nor infirm to travel, its meat fills the stew pot. One of\nthe best knives I ever owned had an erdlu claw edge,\nand the birds sharp beaks make fine spearheads.\nHerders long ago learned to make a kind of light\narmor from the birds scaly wings, and the tendons\nof their long necks make fine bowstrings.\nConsidering the value of even one of these beasts,\nit is no wonder that humans, demihumans, and the\ncreatures of the wastes all regard erdlus as prize\nquarry. Herdsmen must guard their flocks day and\nnight, battling off or fleeing from a startling array of\nraiders, thieves, and monsters.\nAs you might expect, most herdsmen are capable\nfighters, but even these hardy warriors know that it\nis best to avoid a fight whenever possible. Therefore,\nherdsmen tend to be gracious hosts, save that they\ninterrogate their guests mercilessly, trying to learn\nall they can about the location of the dragon, raiding tribes, and anything else that might threaten\ntheir flocks.\nThe douars are generally led by the tribes wizard. The wizard is always a Preserver and never a\nDefiler, for herdsmen have a deep hatred of anyone\nwho deprives them of good grazing land. The wisest\nmember of each family serves as an advisor to the\n3 0</p>\n<p>leader, though the weight given to their opinions varies from tribe to tribe.\nHerdsmen have a deep and abiding respect for\ndruids, and always leave offerings of food and other\ngifts at any place they pass where they know a druid\nresides. Clerics, too, are sure to receive a warm welcome from a herding tribe, for the clerics magic can\nbe of great use in helping the tribe defend its herds.\nTemplars, however, rarely survive a visit to a nomad\ncamp. Herdsmen have independent spirits, and\nthey regard servants of the sorcerer-kings as harbingers of drudgery and slavery.\nElven Herdsmen\nMany elven tribes have become merchants, and\nsome have become raiders, but elves are by nature\nnomads and herders. They are possessed of an independent spirit and a wanderlust unmatched in\nany other Athasian race. This free spirit causes other races to regard elves as deceitful and lazy-which,\neven I must admit, is more or less true if your perspective is that of an honest craftsman or a hardworking merchant-house agent.\nWhat other races fail to understand is that the elf\nwould rather live a short and happy life than a long\nand cheerless one. Elves have adapted to the rigors\nof the Athasian wastelands in a unique way: they\nembrace the inevitability of death and hardship and\nmake no attempt to escape it. In their view, the future is bleak and terrible-so one should do all he\ncan to enjoy life today!\nAdmittedly, this outlook makes elves notoriously\nuntrustworthy, but only where outsiders are concerned. Within their own tribes, they follow a strict\ncode of honor regulating what liberties they can and\ncannot take with the property and rights of others.\nOf course, this code does not apply to those who are\nnot members of the tribe (elven or otherwise), and\nstrangers are expected to look out for themselves.\nThis free-for-all attitude applies even in the area\nof courtship. When a young warrior is ready to take\na mate, he spies upon other tribes, trying to pick out\nOf course, there are a few drawbacks. The only\nfood that kanks provide is a thick green honey secreted by the food producers and stored on their abdomens in melon-sized globules. If the tribe wishes\nKanks can eat nearly anything, so their keepers\ncan wander deeper into harsh wastelands and stay\nlonger than most other herders. In hives, kanks instinctively divide themselves into vicious guards,\nfood producers, and brood queens, so the elves have\nvery little to do in the way of animal husbandry.\nThis leaves them free to devote themselves to their\nfavorite pastime: frenzied feasting and wild revelry.\nElven tribes vary from other herders in more ways\nthan their cultural customs, however. Erdlus cannot\ntravel for long distances at the rapid pace elven\ntribes prefer, so elves prefer to keep kanks instead.\nGenerally speaking, the giant insects are an inferior\nherd animal-but are ideally adapted to the elven\ntemperament and lifestyle.\nWhatever the sex of the victims, once they have\nsuccessfully been taken to the abductors camp, a\nmessenger is sent to the old tribe to announce the\nsafe arrival of the newlyweds. The abductees then\nbecome members of their mates tribe, and all ties\nwith their old tribe are broken. Even if they returned, they would be regarded as outsiders. This\nmay seem a cruel custom, but I doubt that most elven marriages would last for more than a few weeks\nwithout it.\na suitable woman. If he finds one he likes, he hides\noutside the camp until an opportunity comes to steal\nher. If the elf has already approached the maiden\nand she is agreeable to being abducted, she will no\ndoubt make his wait a short one and accompany\nhim with only a token show of resistance. However, if\nthe maiden does not wish to go with the warrior, his\nwait may well be a long one, and when he finally\ndoes have an opportunity to seize her, she just might\nkill him. It should also be noted that I have met several elven women who, wishing to stay with their own\ntribes, stole the male elf of their dreams in this same\nmanner.\n3 1</p>\n<p>to move, it must either move very slowly (for elven\ntastes) so the food producers can keep up, or remove\nall of the honey droplets from the kank abdomens.\nWhile kank honey provides plenty of energy, if you\neat it for more than two or three weeks without a\nsupplement of edible vegetation, you start to lose\nweight and grow weak, just as if you were starving.\nIn addition, the meat of the kank itself is inedible\nwhen a kank is killed, its flesh begins to emit an odor\nso foul that not even a starving man can stomach it.\nAside from its honey, the only useful thing that a\nkank provides is a chitinous armor-providing an elf\nis patient enough to sit outside camp and use sand\nto scrub the stink of the insects flesh off the carapace. Because of these shortcomings, elves are\nforced to spend more time hunting and foraging\nthan other tribes. It is when the hunting is bad, or\nwhen they find themselves in dire need of something\nthey cannot acquire through foraging, that they\nmust turn away from their free-spirited way of life\nand become merchants or raiders.\nRaiding Tribes\nWhen I say that raiders are the parasites of the\ndesert, no one will disagree. Either unable or too lazy to earn their own living, they feed and clothe\nthemselves by stealing from caravans, lonely villages, hermits, and even the cultivated fields surrounding the cities. Their tribes vary in size from a dozen\nindividuals to several hundred, depending on the\nterritory they work and from whom they usually\nsteal.\nAlthough raiders may be scoundrels and cutthroats, they are not fools. They do not prey upon\nthose who stand a chance of fighting back and winning. Tribes numbering no more than one or two\ndozen prey upon hermits and small parties of travelers. On the other hand, the tribes that plunder\ncaravans number in the hundreds, and those that\nloot villages have as many as a thousand members.\nMost raiders make their homes in some forlorn\nplace, such as rocky badlands or a secret oasis in the\nSlave tribes vary from other raiding tribes in several important ways. First is the special treatment\nthey give other slaves. Only ex-slaves are allowed to\njoin a slave tribe, and when they attack a caravan,\ntheir first priority is freeing all the slaves in it. At the\nvery least, these slaves will be given directions to the\ntribes have been known to attack templar caravans\nand expeditions at great risk to themselves-even\nwhen there was no economic incentive!\nThough slave tribes are no less fierce or destructive than other raiders, they tend to leave other villages, hermits, and small parties of travelers alone.\nTheir attention is directed at the city-states themselves, as well as the caravans carrying goods between those city-states. In this regard, we can excuse\ntheir violence, for it almost takes on the character of\na war against their former masters. In fact, slave\nAthas. Usually, these villages serve as the base for a\nraiding tribe, for slaves seldom have the skills necessary to survive in the desert.\nWhen they escape, slaves usually find their way to\none of the many slave villages (see Villages) dotting\nSlave Tribes\nthe leader is a wizard, he will seldom tolerate the\npresence of another wizard in his tribe. If the leader\nis not a wizard, one of his assistants is usually a Defiler who jealously guards his position in the-tribe.\nUsually, the raiding tribes pick their leaders\nthrough a hierarchy of violence. The most deadly\n(often a Defiler) is the leader. Invariably, he chooses\nthe most dangerous and toughest tribe members as\nhis assistants,-ensuring their loyalty through special\nrewards and treatment. The other members of the\ntribe are kept in line through the threat of force. If\nmiddle of a salt plain. Of course, the raiders are\nattempting to hide their location, but the isolation of\ntheir villages also makes it difficult and expensive to\nsend a force to destroy them. This tactic works all\ntoo well; I can count on my fingers the number of\nraiding tribes that I know to have been destroyed in\nretribution for their thievery.\n3 2</p>\n<p>closest safe oasis, and enough food and water to\nreach it. More often, they are offered membership\nin the slave tribe.\nSecond, slave tribes have an innate suspicion of\nthe power that a wizard can wield, so they will never\nallow one to become their commander. Instead, their\nleaders are usually ex-soldiers, slaves, and sometimes gladiators.\nFinally, most raiding tribes are naturally composed of one particular race, but slave tribes tend to\nhave a wider variety of stocks. In every city, a wide\nselection of races are used as slaves. An equally wide\nselection escapes and finds its way to the slave villages, so it should come as no surprise to discover that\nmost slave tribes are composed of a wide variety of\nraces.\nGiant Tribes\nClans of giants inhabit the various islands of the\nSea of Silt, especially those of the Forked Tongue\nestuary. Periodically, a group of them wades ashore\nto raid the fields surrounding a city or to pillage\nsome hapless village. After the raid is finished, they\nwade back to their island homes, secure in the\nknowledge that they cannot be followed.\nFortunately, giants arent such bad people when\nthey arent smashing your home, and they can be\nvery talkative. From the few Ive visited, it appears\nthat when they arent raiding, most of them keep\nsmall herds of erdlus and kanks. They live in huge\nstone huts shaped like beehives, consisting of a single room with the beds and sitting areas along the\nwall. A cooking fire and the food preparation area\nis located in the middle of the room, beneath a\nsmoke-hole in the ceiling of the hut. Housekeeping\nhabits vary by individual; some huts are meticulously clean, others are so cluttered with halffinished projects that even a small person can hardly\nfind a place to sit.\nAs a cautionary note, I should warn you that\nthere are two things you should never do around a\ngiant:\nThri-kreen are intelligent, so it is possible to approach their camp and strike up a conversation\nty they had collected, but had themselves fallen victim to the thri-kreen.\nMost often, raiding thri-kreen are more interested\nin food than in goods. They eat or take away every\nliving being, but seldom take anything that is not of\nimmediate use to them. I once ran across a band of\nhuman scavengers who made a practice of following\na thri-kreen raiding pack around and collecting the\nbooty left behind. Six months later, I ran across the\nsame band of scavengersthey still had all the booThe fact that they never need to sleep and stay in\na state of more or less constant activity makes them\nespecially dangerous. When they start to track a\ncaravan, they can quickly overtake it, then attack\nwithout pausing for a rest. If it is a village they are\nraiding, their tireless nature makes them no less\nmenacing; given two or three days of constant harassment, even the most courageous defenders will be\nreduced to a bundle of quivering nerves.\nMost packs of thri-kreen are hunters (see Hunting and Gathering Clans), but occasionally they\nstart preying on caravans, villages, or even lurking\nabout the outskirts of cities and attacking farm\nslaves. When they start preying upon other intelligent races, they cross the thin line between hunting\nand raiding.\nThri-kreen Tribes\nSecond, never visit a giants island uninvited.\nThey are a very polite race who would not dream of\nvisiting your home uninvited, unless they intended\nto steal something. Most giants assume that you will\nbehave according to similar standards.\nFirst, never assume that just because you see one,\nhes going to attack. When giants come to shore,\nthey usually have a specific goal in mind and will not\nbother anyone who does not stand in their way.\nNothing makes them angrier, however, than being\nattacked just because somebody thinks theyre going to cause trouble.\n3 3</p>\n<p>without becoming a meal. This is one risk I have\npersonally chosen to avoid, however. Even solitary\nthri-kreen tend to be treacherous and unreliable\nand I cannot imagine trusting a group of them.\nHalfling Tribes\nAlthough normally simple hunters and gatherers\n(see Villages and Hunting and Gathering Clans),\nhalflings occasionally come down from the mountains in search of gifts for their chief. Usually, these\ntribes have been assigned such tasks as a form of\npunishment for some trespass they committed\nagainst another tribe or the chief. Halflings have little concept of property, and they regard anything\nthat moves as a potential meal, so it is difficult to\nregard them in the same light as normal raiders\ntheir concept of right and wrong is so different from\nours that it is absurd to hold them to the same moral\nstandards.\nThat does not change the effects of their actions,\nhowever. Halfling tribes will sneak up on a sleeping\ncaravan, a village, sometimes even a city, and carry\naway whatever they can lay their hands on-goods,\nanimals, and people. The animals (and sometimes\nthe people) they eat immediately, but they usually\nattempt to take prisoners and stolen items back to\ntheir village as a gift for the chief.\nThere are two other peculiar things about halfling\nraiding parties. First, no one can tell what the raiders are after, not even the raiders themselves. They\nsimply start taking things until their leader declares\nthat theyve got what they came for, i.e., an item of\nSuch raiding parties are led by the clans normal\nleader, often a fairly powerful psionicist. If it proves\ntoo difficult for the raiders to steal what they want\non the first night of attack, the psionicist usually\ntries to use his talents to help the clan escape. They\nreturn the next night with a different plan of attack,\nand, if they do not succeed, the night after that,\nthen the night after that, etc. They will keep returning until they steal what they want, or until the entire raiding party is destroyed.\nsuitable magnificence for their chief. This can be an\nitem as common as a kank saddle, or something as\nexotic as the bejeweled scabbard of a magical sword.\nSecond, when a halfling raider is captured alive, he\nrefuses to eat or drink, attempting to starve himself\nto death. He will not, however, attempt to escape or\nto kill his captors, as he views his capture as a sacrifice to his clans chief.\nElf Tribes\nElven raiders are nomad or merchant tribes who\nhave been reduced to thievery in order to support\nthemselves. The cause of this transformation is almost always some disaster that has deprived them of\ntheir normal livelihoods, such as the loss of important cargo or a bank hive. Often, the tribe returns to\nits former way of life as soon as it recovers, so it is\nnot uncommon for a group of elves to be raiders one\nyear and merchants the next.\nAttacks by elven raiders are seldom as bloody as\nthose by other groups. Usually, the elves arrange\nsome diversion, such as a stampede or fire, then\nsneak into the camp to steal. If the tribe was formerly a merchant tribe, they place the highest priority\non goods; if it was formerly a herding tribe, they\nusually have the greatest desire for kanks. After\ntheyre finished, the elves rely on their great speed to\nflee, pausing only to disable any means their victims\nmay have of catching them (such as kank mounts).\nAlthough theyll steal everything in sight, elves are\nnot murderous. They rarely attack anyone except\nthose who stand between them and the bounty for\nwhich they came.\nFor more information on elves, see Nomadic\nHerdsmen or Dynastic Merchant Houses.\n3 4</p>\n<p>Hunting and Gathering Clans\nHunting and gathering clans are small groups\nthat make their living through hunting meat animals and foraging for edible plants. Their number\nis usually small, between 10 and 50 individuals, and\ntheir culture is simple and practical. They devote\ntheir free time to making weapons, clothes, and\nshelter; otherwise, they are usually tracking animals\nor foraging for edible plants.\nTheir lifestyle is the most primitive of any on\nAthas, but it is also the freest. They wander across\ngreat tracks of Athas without regard for political\nboundaries, following game wherever it leads. Even\nthough their lives are hard and short, whatever they\ndo, they do for themselves. If a hunter is not hungry,\nhe does not hunt; if he already has a fine bow and\nplenty of arrows, he does not make another; if his\nfamily has a good tent to protect them at night, he\ndoes not erect another.\nMost hunting and gathering clans are thri-kreen\nor halflings, although small groups from other races\nalso make their livings in this manner. Humans\nseem to lack the stamina to endure this lifestyle in\nthe rigorous wastelands of the desert; in all my travels, I have never seen a clan of human huntergatherers.\nThri-kreen\nThri-kreen are hatched to hunt. They roam the\ndesert in packs of up to twenty-five beasts, always\nsearching for fresh quarry. On those rare occasions\nwhen they are not hunting, thri-kreen are making\nweapons. They never sleep, and pause to rest only\nrarely. Unlike most other hunting clans, they do not\nburden themselves with shelters or other belongings,\ntaking with them only what they can carry in their\nown mandibles. Thri-kreen packs usually do not\nhunt other intelligent beings (aside from the occasional elf) unless they have turned to raiding as a\nmeans of supporting themselves.\nThe thri-kreen pack is organized along a strict orThe halfling clans are careful to avoid crossing\ninto each others territory. This would cause hard\nfeelings, perhaps even a fight. If there is one thing\nthat halflings try never to do, it is offend each other.\nThey have learned that by respecting each clans\nThe wild halflings live in the forest along the ridge\nof the Ringing Mountains. Each clan, numbering\nbetween 30 and 75 individuals, hunts and forages\nwithin a strictly defined area of 20 to 30 square\nmiles. Normally, this would be too small an area to\nsupport so many individuals, but the forest ridge is\nunusually abundant in both animal and plant life.\nfastly loyal-unless two or more members gang up\non it in a dominance struggle. When this happens,\nthe thri-kreen assumes that the other members intend to kill it and leaves at the first opportunity.\nHalflings\nsuperior says.\nOnce it joins a group, a thri-kreen remains steadThis pack instinct can make thri-kreen seem belligerent and contentious, yet strangely loyal, in the\neyes of other races. The thri-kreens pack instinct is\nso strong that when a single thri-kreen is a member\nof a group including other races, it attempts to establish a dominance order. The thri-kreen instinctively attempts to bully the other members of the\npack. If they let it get away with this behavior, the\nthri-kreen figures that its the leader of the pack; if\nsomeone stands up to it and defeats it in a contest of\nphysical prowess, the thri-kreen accepts a lower\nplace on the dominance order and does whatever its\nder of dominance. The most aggressive, toughest\nmember is the leader. The second most aggressive\nmember is next in charge, and so forth. Whenever\nthere is any dispute about the dominance order, the\ntwo contenders fight until one of them surrenders or\ndies. After the fight, there is never any bad will between the contestants; once the issue of dominance\nis resolved, they both go about their business with\nthe full security of knowing just where they stand in\nthe pack.\n3 5</p>\n<p>rights and property, all the clans will enjoy longer,\nhappier lives (perhaps the sorcerer-kings should\ntake a lesson from these wild fellows).\nWhen some disaster befalls a clan, they have no\nneed to resort to stealing from one another. Instead,\nthose in need of help simply journey (or send a messenger) to their chief (see Villages) with their request. Assuming the need is genuine, the chief\neither lends his own support or calls upon his other\nsubject clans to aid the one in trouble. This custom\neven applies between chiefs; if one of them is ever\nfaced with a problem he cannot handle, his brothers\nare honor-bound to aid him in whatever manner\nthey can. Because of this custom, which is so deeply\ningrained in the halfling mind that it is very nearly\ninstinct, every clan realizes that it is never to their\nbenefit to fight with another halfling clan.\nUnfortunately for us, this ethic applies only between halflings. They consider anything else (including intelligent races) fair game for the stew\npot-or just to steal from, if there are too many intruders to capture. Captured humans and demihumans are considered a delicacy and are usually\ntaken to the chief as an offering, but some clans eat\ntheir quarry on the spot-particularly if hunting has\nnot been good of late.\nWhen away from their own kind, halflings are\nmistrustful and cautious. I once asked a halfling\nwhy this was. He gave me a spiteful look, then, in all\nseriousness, replied, I know what on your mind.\nYou think not much meat on halfling, but he make\ngood snack someday. Of course, I tried to explain that it is not common practice for humans to\neat their guests, but my little friend refused to believe it. Steadfastly he maintained that, when it\ncame to mealtime, the only race one could trust was\nhis own.\nHermits\nHermits come in all races and from all walks of\nlife. They live alone in some forlorn place far away\nfrom any permanent human or demihuman society,\nOf course, there are as many reasons for people\nto live alone as there are hermits, but I have found\ntwo types of hermits to be fairly common-or, at\nleast, common in hermit terms.\nSome hermits are crazy and dangerous. If you\nlook carefully when you approach an apparently\nabandoned waterhole, you may well see some warning sign: a skeleton here, a piece of discarded armor\nthere, an abandoned wagon over there. Usually, the\nhermit fears that visitors to his waterhole intend him\nharm, or believes they are stealing from him. Such\nhermits rarely confront the offenders directly, however. Even if theyre crazy, theyre not stupid, and\nthey realize that fighting a superior number of\nthirsty beings is not a good idea. Instead, they try to\ntake the visitors unawares, such as after they have\nmade camp and gone to sleep.\nyou. In such cases, dont be put off by the excited hermits rambling conversation, and keep in mind that\nalthough he may quite inadvertently say something offensive to you and will never pause to let you speak, he\ndoes not mean any offense. Most hermits have simply\nforgotten the niceties of conversation.\nOccasionally, if you dont look harmful and the\nhermit is an outcast and not a voluntary recluse, he\nshows himself and tries to strike up a conversation with\nUsually, hermits live near a source of water, but\ntheir residences are not obvious or easy to find. In\nAthas, \nwater \nattracts \nvisitorshuman, \ndemihuman, and otherwise -so it is not always safe for a\nlone individual to reveal his presence. Therefore,\nmost hermits go to considerable trouble to keep the\nlocations of their homes hidden.\ning and herding, though some are also hunters.\nHermits are seldom nomads, for even the most barren patch of Athas can meet the survival needs of a\nsolitary man, providing he is skilled at survival in the\ndesert and is not picky about what he eats.\ncasts. Most survive through a combination of forageither by their own choice or because they are out36</p>\n<p>Psionic Masters\nThose who have truly mastered the art of psionics\nOften, psionic masters accept the role of teacher\n(for they can command outrageous prices in return\nfor their knowledge) and deal quickly with young\nupstarts. When these things become too common,\nhowever, the psionic master finds that the further\ndevelopment of his own abilities comes to a halt. He\nmust spend most of his time teaching his students\nthe basics of the art and dealing with a seemingly\nendless series of second-rate psychics with delusions\nof grandeur. This robs him of the terrific amount of\ntime he requires for his own meditations.\noften become quite famous. They are constantly beseeched by would-be students or adversaries who\nwould like to prove themselves by defeating a known\nmaster.\nWhen this happens, many dedicated psionic masters leave their schools in the hands of trusted disciples, or abandon them altogether and flee into the\ndesert. They seek out some unknown or seldomused waterhole and have a small stronghold erected.\nThe masters shut themselves up inside their strongholds and continue their meditations in the peace\nthat they could not find in the city.\nUsually, a few devoted students accompany the\nmaster to serve as guards and servants, so he is arguably not a hermit. However, a man surrounded by\nguards and sitting in trance for days on end is just\nas alone as if he were sitting upon a mountaintop\nwithout anybody else within a hundred miles. Anybody disturbing a psionic master in such a condition\nquickly realizes that he has made a mistake. Once, I\nencountered a shattered tribe of elves wandering\naimlessly through the desert. Lost and unprovisioned, they clearly had no hope of survival beyond\n3 7</p>\n<p>the next few days. I later learned that they had made\nthe mistake of disturbing a masters trance as they\nattempted to rob his home.\nD r u i d s\nDruids are independent priests who worship and\nally themselves with the various spirits of the land.\nThey serve as guardians and caretakers of the specific terrain feature they worship (such as a particular oasis, an unusual rock formation, a rare expanse\nof grassland, etc.). In return, the spirits of life grant\nthe druids magical powers.\nObviously, a druid must be near the territory he\nprotects (this territory is called his guarded land) in\norder to fulfill his obligations. Usually, this means\nthat he lives in isolation in some desolate part of the\ndesert, living off the land and by the grace of the\nspirit he worships.\nThankfully, druids do not consider normal use\ndesecration. The few who have spoken with me have\nall expressed the firm belief that the land is for all to\nuse, animals and intelligent races alike. They claim\nthat they never use their powers except to safeguard\ntheir guarded lands from abuse.\nMost druids have such a close relationship with\ntheir guarded lands that they desire no contact with\nany strangers that happen to pass their way. Instead, they simply watch the visitors from afar, making their presence known only if the party includes a\nDefiler, or if it does something to desecrate the terrain feature associated with the spirit they worship.\nIf they do make their presence known, it is always for\nthe purpose of attacking. They will use their powers\nto kill or drive away Defilers and others who dont\nrespect the land.\n3 8</p>"}, "title": {"show": false}, "image": {"displayMode": 0}, "sort": 21000}], "sort": 21000}

Though of animal intelligence,\nthey are highly social creatures, structured into several distinct\nclasses by both social function and physical characteristics.\nWater fetcher, worker, and soldier wezers all have wings,\nmultifaceted eyes, and six thin limbs extending from their abdomen. Soldiers are slightly larger than the menials, and are colored a shade of yellow brighter than their fellows. The brood\nqueen is much largershe, too, has wings, but they are insufficient to lift her into flight. The brood queen has a huge abdomen\nfor laying the hives eggs.\nCombat: Water fetcher and worker wezers each have a single\nstinger attack that inflicts 1d4 points of damage. A soldier can\nattack with its stinger twice per round, each hit inflicting 1d4\npoints of damage and requiring the victim to save vs. poison to\navoid being paralyzed by its venom. The paralyzation will take\neffect 2d6 rounds after the failed save and will last for 2d4 days.\nThe brood queen can attack twice per round with her stinger\nand each hit causes 1d6 points of damage. A successful hit by the\nqueens tail injects an egg into the victims stomach, causing an\nadditional 1d6 points of damage. The victim may save vs. poison,\nif successful the egg dies and will not hatch, although the victim\nstill suffers the injection damage. If the save fails, the egg begins\nto grow. Unless it is removed surgically (causing an additional\n1d10 points of damage) or a cure disease spell is cast upon the\ncharacter, the. egg hatches in five days. As the emerging larva\nfeeds, it permanently reduces its hosts Constitution score by 1d4\npoints each day. Once the victim dies, or the larva has fed for ten\ndays, it leaves its hosts body via the ulcerous injection wound,\nand attempts to continue feeding on him from without. Eggs and\nlarva have no attacks and can easily be destroyed.\nHabitat/Society: Wezers build colonies beneath the sands\nwhere they protect the brood queen and allow her to lay eggs.\nFrom the surface, their hives appear to be a series of domes that\nvary from three to eight feet tall, but that are all about five feet in\ndiameter. The domes are constructed by the workers, made\nfrom sand glued together with a bonding resin they secrete. Only one dome actually has an entrance from the surface that leads\ninto the rest of the tunnels.\nThere is 50% chance that the inside of any dome reeks of decay\nand contains a slain creature. The dead beast is bloated and foul,\nwith an ulcerous wound in the abdomen. A single white wezer\nlarva feeds on the body. Every chamber has a four-foot tunnel\nleading down, hidden beneath a six-inch plug of sand and wax\n(treated as a hidden door).\nThe colony tunnels are cool, humid, and six feet in diameter,\njust large enough for half-giants to crawl through. Humans,\nmuls, thri-kreen, elves, and half-elves suffer a -2 penalty on\ntheir attack and damage rolls in the tunnels. Half giants suffer a\n-6. Halflings and dwarves suffer no penalty.\nBeneath the ground is a series of chambers connected by these\ntunnels. Chambers are used to store larva and additional food.\nThe brood queen spends all of her time in the brood chamber.\nWater gatherers fly in the vicinity of the colony in search of\nwater. They either store water directly in wax balls, or they use\nwater to create honey that they store the same way. They hang\nboth types of wax balls in the colony chambers to feed the rest of\nthe adults and to nurture the young. Each sphere contains one\ngallon of either honey or water. The contents are apparent by\nthe shade of the sphere (water is light, honey is dark).\nIn addition to any other treasure found in a wezer lair, there\nare usually about 35 one-gallon wax balls of water and 20 balls of\nhoney hanging from the honey-combed ceiling of the brood\nchamber. Any character can carry three spheres with him. The\nwax lasts one full day outside the hive before melting and spilling. Each day that a character eats at least a quart of the honey,\nhe heals 1d8 points of damage.\nEcology: Workers are charged with construction and maintenance of the domes, chambers, and tunnels of the colony. Water\nfetchers must collect water and store it as either water or honey\nfor the others. The soldiers use poison to fetch live creatures for\nthe queen to lay eggs in. The brood queen herself is the matriarch of the colony. She is mother to all the colonys members, and\nas such is protected to the bitter end. If the colony moves, it\nmoves on the brood queens command only.</p>"}, "title": {"show": false}, "image": {"displayMode": 0}, "sort": 23000}], "sort": 23000}
